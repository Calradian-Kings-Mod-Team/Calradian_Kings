 fp2_yearly.1006.t.ck: "Nordic Cheese?"
 fp2_yearly.1006.desc.ck:0 "I stop at a roadside stall selling some simple foods. The trader, [cheese_trader.GetName], plies me with different wares before reaching below the stall and bringing out a carved wooden box.\n\n"For you my liege, this is the finest cheese in all the realm. [cheese_trader.GetSheHe|U] pushes the small block into my hand, leans in and whispers conspiratorially, "It was crafted by cheese-making Nords here in Geroia."\n\nDespite the bizarre comment, the cheese is incredibly good."
 fp2_yearly.1006.b:0 "I must find these "Cheese Nords"..."
 fp2.1006.b.tt:0 "You send your agents out to find the "Cheese Nords""
 fp2_yearly.1007.desc.ck: "A scrawny looking [fake_cheese_viking.GetWomanMan] is brought before me. However, the pathetic [fake_cheese_viking.GetWomanMan] in front of me barely looks like a cheese maker — let alone a Nord.\n\n"I'm truly sorry, but I'm not really a Nord. It's just a lie to help with selling the cheese," [fake_cheese_viking.GetSheHe] sputters."
 fp2_cheese_artifact_desc.ck: "Despite the rumors, this cheese was not made by Nords. However it is extremely good."
 # Lost Viking - fp2_yearly.1005
 fp2_yearly.1005.t.ck: "Lost Nord"
 fp2_yearly.1005.desc.ck: "Struggling and shouting, a large [hidden_viking.GetWomanMan] is dragged before me. [hidden_viking.GetSheHe|U] is clearly a Nord sea raider, the type who has sown chaos in our realm for decades.\n\n"Please have mercy. My name is [hidden_viking.GetName] and I've been living in [viking_county.GetNameNoTooltip] for years. I was left behind because I was injured. The villagers saved me; they're my family now."\n\nThe viking falls to his knees, hoping I'll spare [hidden_viking.GetHerHis] life. Several peasants confirm [hidden_viking.GetHerHis] story."

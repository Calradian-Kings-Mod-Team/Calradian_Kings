 # Changes and rewrites to existing FP1 events #
 fp2_yearly.1006.t.ck: "Nordic Cheese?"
 fp2_yearly.1006.desc.ck:0 "I stop at a roadside stall selling some simple foods. The trader, [cheese_trader.GetName], plies me with different wares before reaching below the stall and bringing out a carved wooden box.\n\n"For you my liege, this is the finest cheese in all the realm. [cheese_trader.GetSheHe|U] pushes the small block into my hand, leans in and whispers conspiratorially, "It was crafted by cheese-making Nords here in Geroia."\n\nDespite the bizarre comment, the cheese is incredibly good."
 fp2_yearly.1006.b.ck:0 "I must find these "Cheese Nords"..."
 fp2.1006.b.tt.ck:0 "You send your agents out to find the "Cheese Nords""
 fp2_yearly.1007.desc.ck: "A scrawny looking [fake_cheese_viking.GetWomanMan] is brought before me. However, the pathetic [fake_cheese_viking.GetWomanMan] in front of me barely looks like a cheese maker — let alone a Nord.\n\n"I'm truly sorry, but I'm not really a Nord. It's just a lie to help with selling the cheese," [fake_cheese_viking.GetSheHe] sputters."
 fp2_cheese_artifact_desc.ck: "Despite the rumors, this cheese was not made by Nords. However it is extremely good."
 # Lost Viking - fp2_yearly.1005
 fp2_yearly.1005.t.ck: "Lost Nord"
 fp2_yearly.1005.desc.ck: "Struggling and shouting, a large [hidden_viking.GetWomanMan] is dragged before me. [hidden_viking.GetSheHe|U] is clearly a Nord sea raider, the type who has sown chaos in our realm for decades.\n\n"Please have mercy. My name is [hidden_viking.GetName] and I've been living in [viking_county.GetNameNoTooltip] for years. I was left behind because I was injured. The villagers saved me; they're my family now."\n\nThe viking falls to his knees, hoping I'll spare [hidden_viking.GetHerHis] life. Several peasants confirm [hidden_viking.GetHerHis] story."
 fp2_yearly.8005.desc_calradic:0 "They sing in Calradic about life, loss, bittersweet love."
 fp2_yearly.8005.desc_nahasi:0 "They sing in Nahasi about beauty, glory, love lost and found again."
 fp2_yearly.8005.desc_post_troubadours_ck:0 "I thought only the troubadours of Ortysia possessed such talent and wit, but perhaps I was mistaken...\n\nWhat am I to do with these damned #italic feelings#!?"
 fp2_yearly.8006.t.ck:0 "Sturgian Settlers"
 fp2_yearly.8006.desc.ck:0 "A band of several hundred pale-skinned #italic Sturgians#!, enslaved men and women from the southeastern reaches of Calradia, have escaped the realm of my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('former_master'))] [former_master.GetTitledFirstName]. Talk as [former_master.GetSheHe] may about how treasured they were in [former_master.GetHerHis] armies and [former_master.GetHerHis] harem, they have braved many dangers to seek freedom in my land.\n\n"We all have scars", their leader [saqaliba_leader.GetFirstName] tells me, "on our bodies, or deep inside. But we are strong and determined. We long for some land of our own, where we can speak our ancestral tongue. If you let us settle in the [saqaliba_barony.GetName], we would work hard to make it prosper.""
 fp2_yearly.8006.flavor.ck.tt:0 "The Sturgians are forcefully returned to [former_master.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 PerassicRomancelanguage_calradic:0 "Calradian"
 PerassicRomanceLanguage_nahasi:0 "Nahasi"
 fp2_flavor.3001.c.ck:0 "I shall draw no distinctions. [SCOPE.Custom('PerassicSacredLanguage')] and [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetNameNoTooltip] it is."
 fp2_flavor.3001.a.ck:0 "We shall use the [SCOPE.Custom('PerassicSacredLanguage')] language."
 fp2_james.0004.desc.fix: "[fp2_james_0004_place_of_murder.GetName] is an unruly place of diverse belief and governance. Each different community has its leaders, resulting in a complex web of hierarchy and leadership that simply cannot go on. If they all prayed to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] in the proper and correct way and answered to the same leader, it would increase my influence.\n\n[fp2_james_0004_murder_baron.GetName] has stepped forward, aiming to become the [fp2_james_0004_place_of_murder.GetTierAsNamePossessiveNoTooltip|U] new leader and will host a banquet where [fp2_james_0004_murder_baron.GetSheHe] will have all the local religious leaders slaughtered like cattle."
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.asera.a: ""...the Ghūl is a being made purely from nightmares. It sculks through the night, coming upon graveyards at night to consume the recently deceased. Should you enter its gaze, it will consume you with a maw that stretches from one end of the horizon to the other. Only the word of Asera can protect you during those grim hours.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.asera.b: ""...the Arafit, with its thorny hands, flaming eyes or seven heads, will torment you should there ever be cause to do so. If someone has sworn blood vengeance upon you, or sworn the avenging of a murder, arafits are diligent in their task to inflict Ammerah's judgement.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.calradian.a: ""...the Devil's Horses appear when people make bonfires to purify their souls. With manes as black as night, damselfly wings, and mouths foaming, they appear from the ashes with an explosion. Each one is the soul of a sinner with its own tale to tell.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.calradian.b: ""...the Vilotanes are spirits who aid sailors. Angelic in appearance, with eyes the intensity of the sun and wings that look like rays of light, they live in the carmine clouds of sunset. If a good sailor finds themselves becalmed, the Vilotanes will signal a path back to shore.""

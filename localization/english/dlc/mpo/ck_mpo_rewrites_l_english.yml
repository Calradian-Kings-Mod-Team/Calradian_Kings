 # Situation Phases #
 situation_damar_flood_season: "Flooding Season"
 situation_damar_flood_season_desc: "Sometimes, the Damar River's waters will come flooding out of its shallow banks and swallow the land in water. In these circumstances, however, the waters have done more for the land than take away with the land receiving vital minerals."

 situation_damar_disasterous_flood_season: "Disasterous Flooding"
 situation_damar_disasterous_flood_season_desc: "Rarely, the waters of the Damar will come gushing out in a great torrent. Its waters wash away unprotected structures and rip the soil from the land."

 # Damar River - Small flood / Fertility bonus #
 mpo_the_great_steppe.0002.desc.damar_1: "The waters of the Damar overflow into the countryside. Most structures remain relatively unscathed, yet some are less fortunate. The flood waters have also carried essential minerals downstreaming, fertilizing the riverside and helping to increase our crop growth.\n\nThe time has come yet again to sow and rebuild."
 mpo_the_great_steppe.0002.desc.damar_2: "The waters of the Damar overflow into the countryside. Homes are either swept away or flooded to a point beyond near recognition.\n\nThe time has come yet again to rebuild."

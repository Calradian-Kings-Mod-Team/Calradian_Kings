 damar_rivers_events.0001.desc: "With waters flowing from the great lake of Yarwan in the south, to the Jade Sea in the north, the Damar River breathes life into the cruel, scorching heat of the Nahasa Desert. Civilization has existed here for thousands of years and may continue on for another thousand.\n\nLife along the Damar can be both easy and hard. With its life-giving waters carrying vital nutrients and minerals downstream, farmers have long used the river for irrigation and the growing of crops. However, dangers exist in the waters of the Damar. Crocodiles, venomous snakes, hippopotamuses, and lions are among the dangers found along the river. The most deceitful danger, and the greatest killer, is the mosquito.\n\nIn addition, the Damar River is restless, and every few centuries, it leaps its banks and erases what comes before.\n\nCan life truly persist in this region?"
 damar_rivers_events.0001.a: "Persist we must!"

 damar_rivers_events.0002.desc.good_flooding: "The Damar River has yet again spilled its waters over its banks into our lands and homes. The people groan with frustration, but at the same time, they understand these waters carry nutrients and can help improve productivity and crop yield.\n\nMy people look to me to guide them."
 damar_rivers_events.0002.desc.bad_flooding: "The Damar River has flooded again, but only this time with destruction unseen in centuries. Homes and people have been swept away in the carnage. Even if there were nutrients to be found in these flood waters, the torrents tore away the soil and destroyed the crops, meaning any deposits are now useless.\n\nMy people are torn apart by nature, and with the increase in still water, mosquitos have taken up residence in the ruins. The people look to me to guide them."

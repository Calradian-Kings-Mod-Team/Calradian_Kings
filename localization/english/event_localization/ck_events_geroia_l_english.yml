 ck_geroian_events.0001.desc:0 "Historically, whenever foreigners attempt to invade Geroia, the people of the island band together to throw their invaders back into the sea. Even though Geroians may feud among themselves from time to time, their traditions require that all fellow islanders, regardless of their status, wealth or titles, will answer the call to protect their independence.\n\nIt’s without doubt that my campaign against [geroiandefenderloc.GetName] will succeed, nevertheless, I should be cautious about any coalition [geroiandefenderloc.GetSheHe] might rally."
 ck_geroian_events.0001.a:0 "Let them try."

 ck_geroian_events.0002.t:0 "Geroian Coalitions"
 ck_geroian_events.0002.desc:0 "In the long history of Geroia, we have thrown off any invaders and would be conquerors through fleeting moments of cooperation. It is a custom and tradition of Geroians, by this point, to rally their banners to defend fellow islanders against foreign incursions. Such coalitions have been used successfully in the past to throw Calradians back into the sea.\n\nWith [geroianattackerlog.GetName] trying to [geroianattackerlog.GetHerHis] lay hands on our lands, I must be mindful of these facts if we are to secure our independence from [geroianattackerlog.GetHerHis] forces."
 ck_geroian_events.0002.a:0 "Geroia will stand together!"

 ck_geroian_events.0006.desc:0 "The common folk of the realm have risen in my support. Though many among them wield nothing more than crude shields and worn farming tools, their hearts burn with fervor to defend their homeland. Some even are seemingly veterans of prior wars, better armed and disciplined than the rest.\n\nTheir self-appointed leader, a grizzled veteran, approaches me with an offer to help us in this war."
 ck_geroian_events.0006.a:0 "Accept their help."

 ck_geroian_events.0007.desc:0 "The burghers and merchants of my realm, drawing from their own coffers, have raised a force of soldiers and sellswords to aid me in this war. Seasoned and well-equipped, these men may well shift the balance in our favor.\n\nNaturally, such generosity is not without expectation — in return, the burghers seek a reduction in their tax obligations."
 ck_geroian_events.0007.a:0 "Accept their help."
 ck_geroian_events.0007.c:0 "You will help me, whether you like to or not."

 # Landowners sponsor a Host
 ck_geroian_events.0008.t:0 "Landowners' Sponsored Host"
 ck_geroian_events.0008.desc:0 "The barons and minor nobility of my realm have assembled a host of lancissi and dragassi — elite men-at-arms, blooded in war and hardened by years of service. Their reputation alone is enough to make the invaders tremble, and should they ride beneath my banner, we will surely push my enemies back into the sea.\n\nYet such valor comes at a cost. In return for their swords, the nobility press for expanded privileges within the realm. Their captain now stands before me, awaiting my word."
 ck_geroian_events.0008.a:0 "Accept their help."
 ck_geroian_events.0008.c:0 "You will help me, whether you like to or not."

 # "The Melancholic Ransom Broker" - ck_geroian_events.0016
 ck_geroian_events.0016.t: "The Melancholic Ransom Broker"
 ck_geroian_events.0016.desc: "Today in court, I am approached by a finely-dressed man. While he dresses nicely, he has the disposition of a person not of nobility. His brow is furrowed and his face displays emotions of worry and fear. He addresses himself as Zarminner, a Geroian ransom broker, and he has decided to come to my court and plead for my assistance.\n\nHe describes a particular noble he has been trying to ransom back to their family. However, rather than accepting the price of the ransom, the father of the noble has decided to put a bounty on the head of the broker. By the time he finishes his long story, it is clear that Zarminner is expecting me to help them pay off the bounty. He makes promises of discounts on future purchases of prisoners from him."
 ck_geroian_events.0016.a: ""Zarminner has my assistance.""
 ck_geroian_events.0016.a_tooltip: "You will pay for Zarminner's ransom and receive some compensation from him in turn."
 ck_geroian_events.0016.b: ""I don't have time for a bastard of this sort!""
 ck_geroian_events.0016.b_tooltip: "You will turn in Zarminner to [ck_notable_geroia_target.GetName] and receive the bounty, but this will anger many of the ransom brokers around Geroia."

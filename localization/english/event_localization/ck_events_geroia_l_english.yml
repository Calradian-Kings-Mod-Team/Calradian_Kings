Even though Geroians may feud among themselves from time to time, their traditions require that all fellow islanders, regardless of their status, wealth or titles, will answer the call to protect their independence.\n\nIt’s without doubt that my campaign against [geroiandefenderloc.GetName] will succeed, nevertheless, I should be cautious about any coalition [geroiandefenderloc.GetSheHe] might rally."

It is a custom and tradition of Geroians, by this point, to rally their banners to defend fellow islanders against foreign incursions. Such coalitions have been used successfully in the past to throw Calradians back into the sea.\n\nWith [geroianattackerlog.GetName] trying to [geroianattackerlog.GetHerHis] lay hands on our lands, I must be mindful of these facts if we are to secure our independence from [geroianattackerlog.GetHerHis] forces."

 ck_geroian_events.0016.desc: "Today in court, I am approached by a finely-dressed man. While he dresses nicely, he has the disposition of a person not of nobility. His brow is furrowed and his face displays emotions of worry and fear. He addresses himself as Zarminner, a Geroian ransom broker, and he has decided to come to my court and plead for my assistance.\n\nHe describes a particular noble he has been trying to ransom back to their family. However, rather than accepting the price of the ransom, the father of the noble has decided to put a bounty on the head of the broker. By the time he finishes his long story, it is clear that Zarminner is expecting me to help them pay off the bounty. He makes promises of discounts on future purchases of prisoners from him."

Such events in Geroia are moments for excitement and celebration. The [Glossary( 'warrior monks', 'GEROIAN_MONK_GLOSS')] of this island have a long and storied history of being the stalwart defenders against foreigners; the first ones on the battlefield. They carry a certain gravitas with them, and they are highly respected as warriors of the clergy. This monk is no different and the way [geroian_monk_0018.GetSheHe] carries themself is not of self-importance but rather humility and quiet contemplation.\n\nIt is always said that when one of these monks enters your home, [Glossary( 'you must treat them with dignity and hospitality', 'GEROIAN_MONK_XENIA_GLOSS')]. Of course, I can always refuse to house this monk but [geroian_monk_0018.GetSheHe] may not take kindly to this for they are known to lash out at the 'impious'."

 GEROIAN_MONK_XENIA_GLOSS: "With its origins in Thexynian paganism during the Age of Antiquity, the concept of Senija in Geroia, and the surrounding Perassic, was a form of formal hospitality one most bestow upon guests. In Antiquity, violating Senija would be considered trampling on the authority of the gods and would be an invitation to their wrath.\n\nIn recent centuries since the introduction of the Calradian Mandate to Geroia and the surrounding islands, the custom was adopted by the Agreki and Aekekartels.\n\nDisrespecting Senija is the worst transgression one can commit in Geroia, and the people of Geroia have a long memory."

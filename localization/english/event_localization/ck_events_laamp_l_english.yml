 # Visit Lake Rat Hideout #
 ck_visit_special_buildings.0001.desc_intro_hideout: "In the hazy distance, I can make out the Lake Rat hideout. Its own size is dwarfed by the massive mountain and cliff it sits within. It is no wonder the Lake Rats have made a home here.\n"
 ck_visit_special_buildings.0001.desc: "As I enter the huge cove, the roof of this cliff creaks and moans with activity from under the earth. The part of the island used to be a volcano ages ago, but this part of the great volcano blew out into a natural cove.\n\nFinally making landfall on the beach made of volcanic sand, the hideout comes into plain view now. Signs of activity can be seen in every nook and cranny of the cove. Some Lake Rats are moving their ill-gotten loot off of their ships and onto the docks. Less than reputable-looking merchants peddle their wares to others, and a faint glimmer can be seen from a volcanic tube further into the cove.\n\nNow, what should I do?"

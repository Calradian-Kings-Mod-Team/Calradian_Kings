 ck_rhodok.0001.desc: "News has reached my court of a man, in our region, who appears to be recruiting hosts of Rhodoks and taking them with him back into the Biscan Hills to train. He may just be a mercenary looking to make work in these wartorn lands, but it may also be wise to keep an eye on this man. Should he chose so, he may cause a great deal of damage to the lowlands."
 ck_rhodok.0001.a: "We will watch him with great interest."

 ck_rhodok.0002.t: "Highland Mustering"
 ck_rhodok.0002.desc: "Recent weeks have seen a slew of reports from [grunwalder_county_0002.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetName] of activities by the 'Rhodok' rebel leader known as Grunwalder. He has been using the area as a base for recruitment and has driven the local peasants into resistance against our tax collectors. Additionally, many of the peasants have been convinced, or coerced, into joining in his rebel band.\n\nMy marhsal, [marshal.GetName] has offered to take some soldiers to put down the unrest in [grunwalder_county_0002.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetNameNoTier], but this risks further alienating the locals against my control. I could, of course, go myself as well, but this might prove even riskier. Going into a mob of angry peasants, even with soldiers, always presents a risk."
 ck_rhodok.0002.b: "Send in my marshal to wipe them up!"
 ck_rhodok.0002.c: "I will do this myself."
 ck_rhodok.0002.b.crit_success: "Your marshal successfully subdue the rebels and drive out Grunwalder"
 ck_rhodok.0002.b.success: "Your marshal subdues most of the rebel peasants, but they still persist albeit in smaller numbers"
 ck_rhodok.0002.b.failure: "Your marshal has utterly failed to stop the rebel peasants from rampaging across the county"
 ck_rhodok.0002.b.death: "In attempting to subdue the peasants, your martial was torn to piece by the mob"
 ck_rhodok.0002.b.crit_success.me: "You succeeded in subduing the rebels and driving out Grunwalder"

 ck_rhodok.0003.t: "Grunwalder Ambushes"
 ck_rhodok.0003.desc: "Grunwalder, the damnable peasant, has spread out from the Biscan Hills, and began a chain of ambushes across our holdings in the south. Tax collectors who are sent out do return, but instead their collections only enrich the pockets of the rebels. And when sheriffs are sent out to restore order, they too do not return home. The issue has begun to balloon out of hand, as the money meant to go towards my coffers has instead been stolen to fund an ever growing band of 'Rhodok' rebels.\n\nThe lack of men willing to sign on to be sheriffs has also become a concern, and it seems that those who side against the rebels have become increasingly viewed as traitors and robbers. They have even begun to refer to me as a robber baron, and have questioned my right to rule."
 ck_rhodok.0003.a: ""Damn him!""
 ck_rhodok.0003.b: ""Doesn't he understand that money is for their protection?""
 ck_rhodok.0003.c: ""Send more collectors, and with guards!""
 ck_rhodok.0003.d: ""I am no #V Robber Baron!#! Send more money to the people!""

 ck_rhodok.0004.t: "The Burning South"
 ck_rhodok.0004.desc: "For years now, the south of Vlandia had been home to a diverse group of migrants from Balion. Oftentimes used as a springboard for ambitious nobles before they travel further inland, it has been becoming an issue as of late. The local peasantry, fascinated with the growing 'Rhodok' movement, have united behind a figure named Grunwalder and claim the crown has treated them as a backwater for too long.\n\nGrunwalder has since taken to banditry and stirring up the local peasants into armed revolt, worsening the already tenuous situation in the South.\n\nIf we don't act soon, things could reach a point of no return."

 ck_rhodok.0004.b: "Worrying."

The host took on the name of their great leader, Wilund—Vlandian to the Calradians—but their numbers were diverse. Coming from all corners of Balion, the Vlandian host consisted of the northern Gotts, the eastern Rhoyd and Kassen, and the Swads, from whom the majority of Vlandians now descend.\n\nNow that those great years have passed, we are beginning to see a shift in attitudes toward one another. We were once brothers-in-arms in service to Wilund. Now, we are increasingly at each other's throats. The Rhoyd, Kassen, and the peasantry of southern Vlandia are growing resentful of the Vlandian nobility. In a time long ago, the Rhoyd and Kassen were republican city-states and only joined Wilund’s adventuring host for the prospect of richer lands. Some among them are now calling for a return to more republican traditions, in contrast to the hereditary system of the Vlandian monarchy—which they claim is made up of "thieving bastards on thrones."\n\n#bold Now, everything is starting to unravel, and only time will tell if anyone—or anything—can mend this growing schism.#!"

Isolated from the influences of the Vlandian nobility, a new, fiercely independent people have taken shape based on the qualities of those four cultures.\n\nThey have taken to calling themselves "Rhodoks." As the Rhoyd, Kassen, Jendean, and Togerdi cultures give way to this new tide, the Vlandians to the north see this development as detrimental to their entrenched power. Although many Vlandians have long since forgotten their Balionian name, others have not and have opted to call themselves Swads in response to the growing presence of Rhodoks and a renewed sense of cultural identity among the Kingdom of Vlandia.\n\n"

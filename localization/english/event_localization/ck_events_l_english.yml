 # Patricians offer support for expedition
 ck_imperial_events.0015.t:0 "Local Patricians Offer Support"
 ck_imperial_events.0015.desc:0 "The local patricians within the city of [stolica.GetNameNoTier] have come to offer their support in my expedition. This is to be expected, of course, since they are often given land and titles in new conquests, however accepting their support would be effectively promising to grant them land in the coming war.\n\nOf course, I could keep that land small and inconsequential, but to rely on others would make me look like a weak emperor, which would likely upset the royalist faction. I could therefore refuse their support, which would endear me to the royalists, and make me seem like a stronger emperor.\n\nSome of the populist voices within the senate have also reached me regarding an additional option. I could use the donations from the patricians to support the local plebian class, which would endear me to them and greatly please the populist faction. Of course, this would likely upset the militarists who would see this as a betrayal of the war effort. So too would the oligarchs dislike the populist policies.\n\nStill, the choice is in my hands, and the support, however small, would surely aid in the coming war."

 ck_imperial_events.0016.desc:0 "While it was once tradition for any new lands that are conquered to be given first to the military who conquered them, increasingly as the empire shrinks in span this tradition has fallen to increasing irrelevance, and it is instead expected that I give out the land as I see fit. Normally, of course, this means that the land is given to influential oligarchs and nobles, rather than the common soldiery.\n\nHowever, [asking_populist.GetTitledFirstName] has come to me to ask that the land be given not to the well-to-do nobles of [nazwaimperium.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], but rather instead to the plebians who currently suffer in our own lands from the lasting effects of the civil war and other problems. This would please the people greatly, but it could lead to a lasting dislike from the non-populist vassals in my empire.\n\nThere is, of course, another option. I could return to tradition, and give the land to the soldiers instead. This would not upset the populists as much as directly refusing their request and would shore up support amongst the soldiers for the war, as well as the militarist camp."

Claiming the expedition is doomed without [asking_royalist.GetHerHis] support.\n\nWhile it would displease my other vassals, I could simply give [asking_royalist.GetHerHim] some more money, it is not unheard of in imperial wars for those who contribute more to receive additional funding from the emperor. However, this could, indeed, set a dangerous precedent as well, should I directly reimburse [asking_royalist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], others would likely expect the same.\n\nSome from the militarist faction have offered a compromise, I could pay the vassal for [asking_royalist.GetHerHis] role, but [asking_royalist.GetSheHe] would have to supply more soldiers for the coming expedition. This would likely please everyone, but would be more costly due to having to arm and supply those troops myself"

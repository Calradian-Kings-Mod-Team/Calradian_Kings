 cultural_festival.2020.desc.darusmas:0 "The bells toll and the locals ready themselves for mass. They animatedly chatter about the birth of Darusos. "There was a monkey, I tell you!", "And it happened near the river, just like here.", "When my child comes I hope you give him as much gold!"\n\nA short play promptly follows, and the crucified Lord is born."
 cultural_festival.2020.desc.calradios:0 "The festival begins with a beautifully crafted chariot ridden by [stop_host_scope.GetTitledFirstName], draped red and purple linens draped behind [stop_host_scope.GetHimHer] like some long magnificent tail through the streets.\n\nWith a wave of [stop_host_scope.GetHerHis] hand, [stop_host_scope.GetTitledFirstName] reaffirms their commitment to Calradios' legacy. Next [stop_host_scope.GetTitledFirstName] turns to [stop_host_scope.GetHerHis] [stop_host_scope.GetFaith.BishopNeuterFamished] to receive the blessing to commence the festivites. With the blessing given, we are soon finally able to sit down to eat, drink, gamble, and celebrate. Food, from steaming [stop_host_scope.Custom('get_region_root_vegetable_plural')] to [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalEdibleMeat')] with some nice [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalEdibleMeat')] to wash it all down, is brought before us in an extravagant meal! I receive a small marble figure from [stop_host_scope.GetTitledFirstName] in the likeness of Calradios."

 tour_travel.1004.desc.calradian.intro:0 "I enter [diseased_county_scope.GetName], ready to bestow my royal touch upon the local peasantry. I am immediately faced with what is undoubtedly the most wretched creature I have ever laid eyes upon. With minimal provocation, [diseased_peasant.GetSheHe] exposes [diseased_peasant.GetHerHis] calloused hands just inches from my own pristine hands.\n\n"

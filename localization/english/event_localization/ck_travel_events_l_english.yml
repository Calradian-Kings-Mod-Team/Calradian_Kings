Each word [local_commoner.GetSheHe] utters seems to warp in my ears, half-recognizable, yet slipping away before meaning can settle. [local_commoner.GetSheHe|U] gestures occasionally, hands moving in a way that might help bridge the gap in understanding, but the confusion only grows. [local_commoner.GetHerHis|U] respect is clear, but [local_commoner.GetHerHis] words... are not.\n\nI catch glimpses of familiar terms: "lordship", "kind", "road", but the rest is a muddled sea of consonants and vowels, swirling together beyond comprehension."

 ep3_laamp_decision_event.4100.desc: "As I enter the hideout, the pungent smell of fish fills the air. Looking around, I can see an assortment of raiders, fishers, and less than reputable merchants peddling their merchandise."
 ep3_laamp_decision_event.4100.desc_returned_from_ratking: "Walking back into the bustling center of the hideout from the Rat King's 'throne room', the smell hits me yet again but this time with less of an effect."
 ep3_laamp_decision_event.4100.desc_returned_from_lakerat_tavern: "Leaving the loud tavern to enter the main part of the hideout, the volume of noise has not gone down considering the openess of the area."

 ## Geroia
 # Visit Great Citadel 
 ck_travel_events.1002.t: "The Great Citadel of Geroia"
 ck_travel_events.1002.intro: "After hours of drudging through the steep cliffs and roads, we finally make it to the great walls of the Great Citadel of Geroia. With its menacing, towering walls covering both flanks of the valley, we can make out the shape of its Warrior Monk inhabitants gazing at us."
 ck_travel_events.1002.intro_ruined: "After hours of drudging through the steep cliffs and roads, we finally make it to the ruined walls of the Great Citadel of Geroia. The walls have since crumbled, likely due to some earthquake or siege. The warrior monks still maintain a garrison on the remaining parts of the walls, and they gaze down upon us as we approach."
 ck_travel_events.1002.geroian: "\n\nThese [Glossary( 'warrior monks', 'GEROIAN_MONK_GLOSS')] maintain a watchful vigilance of the tight mountain pass that divides north and south Geroia. Built nearly a millenia ago, its walls have since crumbled and been rebuilt in order to keep invaders, usually Thonians, from penetrating into the south."
 ck_travel_events.1002.friend: "\n\nIt is said that these warrior monks once withstood an assault from the Calradian Empire itself, and in doing so were able to destroy an entire legion! What a remarkable feat of Geroian engineering."
 ck_travel_events.1002.praise_outro: "\n\nHere, a handful of monks were able to hold off entire armies by themselves, and in doing so, managed to safeguard the south of Geroia."
 ck_travel_events.1002.distrust_outro: "\n\nAs we press on through the gates and the settlement inside, furtive shapes mimic our progress through the mountain pass like shades."
 ck_travel_events.1002.a_geroian: "The #EMP warrior monks#! be praised!"
 ck_travel_events.1002.a_non_geroian: "A fateful place."
 ck_travel_events.1002.b: "Ominous."
 GEROIAN_MONK_GLOSS: "The Warrior Monks of Geroia are an ancient order of zealots who have since the 187 A.C defend the pass between north and south Geroia. At first monks of the [GetFaithByKey( 'thexnyian_pagan' ).GetName] pagan faith, then the more peaceful [GetFaithByKey( 'aekekartel' ).GetName] following Calradic proselytization, and lately the more militaristic [GetFaithByKey( 'agreki' ).GetName], the monks have always stood guard at the walls of the Great Citadel regardless of their faith allegiances at the time.\n\nWarrior Bishops across Geroia are often trained inside of the walls of the Great Citadel, and terms monk and bishop are often interchangeable in Geroia."

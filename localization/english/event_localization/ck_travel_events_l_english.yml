 ck_travel_events.0001.desc:0 "As I travel through [local_commoner.GetCulture.GetName] countryside, a figure emerges from the horizon. A local commoner, with a smile on [local_commoner.GetHerHis] face and a humble posture, approaches with cautious respect.\n\n[local_commoner.GetSheHe|U] begins to speak, [local_commoner.GetHerHis] voice earnest yet muddled, heavy with the thick dialect of [local_commoner.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] Calradian. Each word [local_commoner.GetSheHe] utters seems to warp in my ears, half-recognizable, yet slipping away before meaning can settle. [local_commoner.GetSheHe|U] gestures occasionally, hands moving in a way that might help bridge the gap in understanding, but the confusion only grows. [local_commoner.GetHerHis|U] respect is clear, but [local_commoner.GetHerHis] words... are not.\n\nI catch glimpses of familiar terms: "lordship", "kind", "road", but the rest is a muddled sea of consonants and vowels, swirling together beyond comprehension."

 ## Description of Family Choice ##
 family_type_ck_backstory: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('family_type_ck_backstory')]\n\nGrowing up, you had more opportunities than most other kids. Your family, and those they surrounded themselves with, took notice of your behavior, and you were noted for..."
 # Vlandia/Fallback #
 FAMILY_V_1: "Your father was a bailiff for a local feudal magnate. He looked after his liege's estates, resolved disputes in the village, and helped train the village levy. He rode with the lord's cavalry, fighting as an armored knight."
 FAMILY_V_2: "Your family were merchants in one of the main cities of the kingdom. They organized caravans to nearby towns and were active in the local merchant's guild."
 FAMILY_V_3: "Your family were small farmers with just enough land to feed themselves and make a small profit. People like them were the pillars of the kingdom's economy, as well as the backbone of the levy."
 FAMILY_V_4: "Your family owned a smithy in a city. Your father played an active if minor role in the town council, and also served in the militia."
 FAMILY_V_5: "Your family lived in a village, but did not own their own land. Instead, your father supplemented paid jobs with long trips in the woods, hunting and trapping, always keeping a wary eye for the lord's game wardens."
 FAMILY_V_6: "Your father joined one of Vlandia's many mercenary companies, composed of men who got such a taste for war in their lord's service that they never took well to peace. Their crossbowmen were much valued across Calradia. Your mother was a camp follower, taking you along in the wake of bloody campaigns."
 FAMILY_FB_6: "Your father joined one of the many mercenary companies, composed of men who got such a taste for war in their lord's service that they never took well to peace. Their men were much valued across the land. Your mother was a camp follower, taking you along in the wake of bloody campaigns."

 # Empire #
 FAMILY_E_1: "Your father was a trusted lieutenant of the local landowning aristocrat. He rode with the lord's cavalry, fighting as an armored lancer."
 FAMILY_E_2: "Your family were merchants in one of the main cities of the Empire. They sometimes organized caravans to nearby towns, and discussed issues in the town council."
 FAMILY_E_3: "Your family were small farmers with just enough land to feed themselves and make a small profit. People like them were the pillars of the imperial rural economy, as well as the backbone of the levy."
 FAMILY_E_4: "Your family owned their own workshop in a city, making goods from raw materials brought in from the countryside. Your father played an active if minor role in the town council, and also served in the militia."
 FAMILY_E_5: "$FAMILY_V_5$"
 FAMILY_E_6: "Your family numbered among the many poor migrants living in the slums that grow up outside the walls of imperial cities, making whatever money they could from a variety of odd jobs. Sometimes they did service for one of the Empire's many criminal gangs, and you had an early look at the dark side of life."

 # Aserai #
 FAMILY_A_1: "Your family was from a smaller offshoot of an emir's tribe. Your father's land gave him enough income to afford a horse but he was not quite wealthy enough to buy the armor needed to join the heavier cavalry. He fought as one of the light horsemen for which the desert is famous."
 FAMILY_A_2: "Your father was part of one of the slave-bodyguards maintained by the Aserai emirs. He fought by his master's side with tribe's armored cavalry, and was freed - perhaps for an act of valor, or perhaps he paid for his freedom with his share of the spoils of battle. He then married your mother."
 FAMILY_A_3: "Your family were respected traders in an oasis town. They ran caravans across the desert, and were experts in the finer points of negotiating passage through the desert tribes' territories."
 FAMILY_A_4: "Your family tilled the soil in one of the oases of the Nahasa and tended the palm orchards that produced the desert's famous dates. Your father was a member of the main foot levy of his tribe, fighting with his kinsmen under the emir's banner."
 FAMILY_A_5: "Your family were part of a nomadic clan, crisscrossing the wastes between wadi beds and wells to feed their herds of goats and camels on the scraggly scrubs of the Nahasa."
 FAMILY_A_6: "Your father worked for a fitiwi, one of the strongmen who keep order in the poorer quarters of the oasis towns. He resolved disputes over land, dice and insults, imposing his authority with the fitiwi's traditional staff."

 # Khuzait #
 FAMILY_K_1: "Your family were the trusted kinsfolk of a Khuzait noyan, and shared his meals in the chieftain's yurt. Your father assisted his chief in running the affairs of the clan and fought in the core of armored lancers in the center of the Khuzait battle line."
 FAMILY_K_2: "Your family came from one of the merchant clans that dominated the cities in eastern Calradia before the Khuzait conquest. They adjusted quickly to their new masters, keeping the caravan routes running and ensuring that the tariff revenues that once went into imperial coffers now flowed to the khanate."
 FAMILY_K_3: "Your family were middle-ranking members of one of the Khuzait clans. He had some  herds of his own, but was not rich. When the Khuzait horde was summoned to battle, he fought with the horse archers, shooting and wheeling and wearing down the enemy before the lancers delivered the final punch."
 FAMILY_K_4: "Your family tilled one of the small patches of arable land in the steppes for generations. When the Khuzaits came, they ceased paying taxes to the emperor and providing conscripts for his army, and served the khan instead."
 FAMILY_K_5: "Your family were guardians of the sacred traditions of the Khuzaits, channelling the spirits of the wilderness and of the ancestors. They tended the sick and dispensed wisdom, resolving disputes and providing practical advice."
 FAMILY_K_6: "Your family's clan never pledged its loyalty to the khan and never settled down, preferring to live out in the deep steppe away from his authority. They remain some of the finest trackers and scouts in the grasslands, as the ability to spot an enemy coming and move quickly is often all that protects their herds from their neighbors' predations."

 # Battania #
 FAMILY_B_1: "Your family were the trusted kinfolk of a Battanian chieftain, and sat at his table in his great hall. Your father assisted his chief in running the affairs of the clan and trained with the traditional weapons of the Battanian elite, the two-handed sword or falx and the bow."
 FAMILY_B_2: "Your parents were healers who gathered herbs and treated the sick. As a living reservoir of Battanian tradition, they were also asked to adjudicate many disputes between the clans."
 FAMILY_B_3: "Your family were middle-ranking members of a Battanian clan, who tilled their own land. Your father fought with the kern, the main body of his people's warriors, joining in the screaming charges for which the Battanians were famous."
 FAMILY_B_4: "Your family were smiths, a revered profession among the Battanians. They crafted everything from fine filigree jewelry in geometric designs to the well-balanced longswords favored by the Battanian aristocracy."
 FAMILY_B_5: "Your family had little land of their own, so they earned their living from the woods, hunting and trapping. They taught you from an early age that skills like finding game trails and killing an animal with one shot could make the difference between eating and starvation."
 FAMILY_B_6: "Your father was a bard, drifting from chieftain's hall to chieftain's hall making his living singing the praises of one Battanian aristocrat and mocking his enemies, then going to his enemy's hall and doing the reverse. You learned from him that a clever tongue could spare you  from a life toiling in the fields, if you kept your wits about you."

 # Sturgia #
 FAMILY_S_1: "Your father was a member of a boyar's druzhina, the 'companions' that make up his retinue. He sat at his lord's table in the great hall, oversaw the boyar's estates, and stood by his side in the center of the shield wall in battle."
 FAMILY_S_2: "Your family were merchants who lived in one of Sturgia's great river ports, organizing the shipment of the north's bounty of furs, honey and other goods to faraway lands."
 FAMILY_S_3: "Your family had just enough land to feed themselves and make a small profit. People like them were the pillars of the kingdom's economy, as well as the backbone of the levy."
 FAMILY_S_4: "$FAMILY_E_4$"
 FAMILY_S_5: "Your family had no taste for the authority of the boyars. They made their living deep in the woods, slashing and burning fields which they tended for a year or two before moving on. They hunted and trapped fox, hare, ermine, and other fur-bearing animals."
 FAMILY_S_6: "Your family numbered among the poor migrants living in the slums that grow up outside the walls of the river cities, making whatever money they could from a variety of odd jobs. Sometimes they did services for one of the region's many criminal gangs."

 CK_YOUTH_3_desc: "All of Calradia's kingdoms recognize the value of good light cavalry and horse archers, and are sure to recruit nomads and borderers with the skills to fulfill those duties.

 ck_adventure_desc: "[ROOT.Char.Custom('achievement_ck_backstory')]\n\nThis moment in your life was one of the turning points to a life of adventurism. When many others would stay in their villages and towns, tending to life as usual, you had a spark of ambition that set you apart from them. This spark would be the start of your great adventure."

 CK_ACH_3_desc: "Your parents didn't give you much money, but they did leave just enough for you to purchase a plot of unused land at the edge of the village. You cleared away rocks and dug an irrigation ditch, raised a few seasons of crops, than sold it for a considerable profit."
 CK_ACH_3_V_desc: "Your parents didn't give you much money, but they did leave just enough for you to secure a loan against a larger amount to build a small workshop. You paid back what you borrowed, and sold your enterprise for a profit."

 CK_ACH_4_desc: "Wolves, bears are a constant menace to the flocks of northern Calradia, while hyenas and leopards trouble the south. You went with a group of your fellow villagers and fired the missile that brought down the beast."
 CK_ACH_4_V_desc: "Your hometown was briefly placed under siege, and you were called to defend the walls. Everyone did their part to repulse the enemy assault, and everyone is justly proud of what they endured."

 CK_ACH_5_desc: "Maybe it was a love affair, or maybe you cheated at dice, or maybe you just chose your words poorly when drinking with a dangerous crowd. Anyway, you got into the kind of trouble from which only a quick tongue or quick feet get you out alive."
 CK_ACH_5_E_desc: "Maybe it was a love affair, or maybe you cheated at dice, or maybe you just chose your words poorly when drinking with a dangerous crowd. Anyway, on one of your trips into town you got into the kind of trouble from which only a quick tongue or quick feet get you out alive."

 CK_ACH_6_desc: "Yours wasn't the kind of reputation that local legends are made of, but it was the kind that wins you respect among those around you.

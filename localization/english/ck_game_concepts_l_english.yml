 game_concept_calradiancivilwar_desc:0 "       The Calradian Civil War occurred a few months following the death of the late emperor, Arenicos. Although Arenicos was able to stabilize the Calradian Empire following the Battle of Pendraic, the underlying societal issues still existed. Many of these issues were exacerbated by many of Arenicos' choices, whether intentional or not.\n\n       One of these issues pertained to the rise of a people's cult who began to worship Arenicos as a divine savior. This may have had the consequence of enraging the aristocrats and senators. Another issue was the establishment of a royal bodyguard which used an imperial militia to fill its ranks.\n\n       Whatever grievances or reasons led to this war, the assassination of Arenicos was the nail in the coffin for the Calradian Empire."

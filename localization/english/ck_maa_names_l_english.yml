 ## Vlandian Troops ##
 vlandian_light_infantry:0 "Vlandian Infantry"
 vlandian_light_infantry_flavor:0 "#F Every Vlandian village is expected to supply a levy of troops for their liege lord. Although their lords care little for arming them, these infantrymen can prove to be incredibly resourceful.#!"
 vlandian_heavy_infantry:0 "Vlandian Sergeants"
 vlandian_heavy_infantry_flavor:0 "#F Sergeants are veterans of wars whether domestic or foreign, either as part of their liege's armies or as mercenaries. They make up the anvil in a Vlandian 'Hammer-and-Anvil'.#!"
 vlandian_pikemen:0 "Vlandian Pikemen"
 vlandian_pikemen_flavor:0 "#F Fitted with fine gambesons and long pikes, these infantrymen act as defensive hedgehogs against any intrepid cavalry force.#!"
 vlandian_bowmen:0 "Vlandian Levy Bowmen"
 vlandian_bowmen_flavor:0 "#F Although a lot less effective than their crossbow counterparts, levy bowmen can still be fielded when the coin purse is feeling tight.#!"
 vlandian_crossbowmen_1:0 "Vlandian Crossbowmen"
 vlandian_crossbowmen_1_flavor:0 "#F When Vlandian warlords discovered the imperial crossbow, they wasted no time in developing their own version of it. They then taught their levies how to wield it against their enemies.#!"
 vlandian_crossbowmen_2:0 "Vlandian Sharpshooters"
 vlandian_crossbowmen_2_flavor:0 "#F Southern Vlandia is renowned for its tradition of training the best arbelists in Calradia. These folks are ready for everything, be it an incoming knight or a longbowman. #!"
 vlandian_light_cavalry_1:0 "Vlandian Squires"
 vlandian_light_cavalry_1_flavor:0 "#F Training to be knight themselves, these children of lower nobility are eager to prove themselves. Fielding this cavalry can be cheaper than the more costly vanguard nobility.#!"
 vlandian_light_cavalry_2:0 "Vlandian Vanguard"
 vlandian_light_cavalry_2_flavor:0 "#F Sons or daughters of wealthy burghers, minor nobility, or anyone who can afford a horse, Vanguard Cavalry make up the majority of light cavalry in the Vlandian army as flankers and outriders.#!"
 vlandian_heavy_cavalry_1:0 "Vlandian Knights"

 ## Swadian Troops ##
 swadian_light_infantry:0 "Swadian Militia"
 swadian_light_infantry_flavor:0 "Swadian Militia are formed out of the commoners of Swadia, those who exist entirely beneath the boot. They've bene somewhatdrilled and equipped, but are still ultimately just armed peasants."
 swadian_heavy_infantry:0 "Swadian Sergeants"
 swadian_heavy_infantry_flavor:0 "Servorins was a role in the Calradian Empire that denoted a personal retainer of an Patrician. Swadian Sergeants, originating from the militia who had been appointed 'servorins' to various Vlandian nobles, generally better equipped and distinguished in combat, evolved as an elite force of infantry, built from veterans of the Militia." #this loosely parallels the evolution of the real life sergeant, with some variation.
 swadian_pikemen:0 "Swadian Pikemen"
 swadian_pikemen_flavor:0 "Swadian Pikemen are formed out of Militia who elect to continue serving after their draft expires, an exchange for better food and gold that most are forced into, as a man at war does not plow. "
 swadian_crossbowmen_1:0 "Swadian Skirmishers"
 swadian_crossbowmen_1_flavor:0 "The crossbow saw widespread adoption throughout Vlandia, which quickly became a way for nobles to prepare a defense against the Knights of better off nobles. Swadian skirmishers are the adaptation of this practice to further centuries of warfare. Lightly equipped, armed with subpar crossbows, they are designed to quickly strike at the enemy before retreating behind lines of infantry."
 swadian_crossbowmen_2:0 "Swadian Sharpshooters"
 swadian_crossbowmen_2_flavor:0 "The pinnacle of the Balion-adoption of the crossbow, expertly trained crossbowmen equipped in heavier armor to strike and defend positions under threat. Their crossbows too are a marked upgrade over the more simpler crossbows used by Skirmishers. The Swadian Sharpshooters differ from their Rhodok counterparts by often lacking shields, due to a lack of recieving crossbow fire, which was always targeted against Knights."
 swadian_light_cavalry:0 "Swadian Men-at-Arms"
 swadian_light_cavalry_flavor:0 "Swadian Men-at-Arms are formed out of an elite cadre of petty nobles, poor knights, and the retinue of more important nobility and knighthood. They form an effective, if not as impressive as true Knights, cavalry."
 swadian_heavy_cavalry:0 "Swadian Knights"
 swadian_heavy_cavalry_flavor:0 "Swadian Knights are the crème de la crème of the Swadian military, if not Swadia itself. Swadian Knights are formed out of welly armored Knights and other nobility. Their charge shatters bone, and bends armies to heel."
 
 ## Rhodok Troops ##
 rhodok_light_infantry:0 "Rhodok Tribesmen"
 rhodok_light_infantry_flavor:0 "The Rhodok tribesman holds himself above the Swadian militiaman, calling himself free from draft and levy. However, they are forced to march to war none-the-same, driven not by bonds of feudalism, but bonds of tribal ties."
 rhodok_heavy_infantry:0 "Rhodok Sergeants"
 rhodok_heavy_infantry_flavor:0 "Servorins was a role in the Calradian Empire that denoted a personal retainer of an patrician. Rhodok Sergeants, originating from the peasant's leagues who had protected independence fighters, form an elite cadre in Rhodok armies. They are formed out of veteran soldiers, who've accumalated enough denar to pay for better equipment, and sidearms."
 rhodok_pikemen:0 "Rhodok Veteran Spearmen"
 rhodok_pikemen_flavor:0 "Oftentimes the bar between a 'spearman' and a 'sergeant' becomes blurry, as sergeants aim to keep those they dislike out of the prestige of the role. These aspiring sergeants, or politically blocked sergeants, are often formed into different units, where they are forced against the Swadian Knight."
 rhodok_bowmen:0 "Rhodok Tribal Archers"
 rhodok_bowmen_flavor:0 "Rhodok Tribesmen often come equipped with bows, weapons that the Balians were much closer to before the crossbow."
 rhodok_crossbowmen_1:0 "Rhodok Crossbowmen"
 rhodok_crossbowmen_1_flavor:0 "Rhodoks in the more centralized urban cities of Rhodokia find themselves utilizing the crossbow far more than the bow, the bow considered a weapon of the tribes and those who hunted, a negative association in the south. They form into poorly armoured, but welly armed with crossbows. Indeed, forgoing armor due to the surplus of bolts to pierce through it."
 rhodok_crossbowmen_2:0 "Rhodok Sharpshooters"
 rhodok_crossbowmen_2_flavor:0 "The pinnacle of the Balion-adoption of the crossbow, expertly trained crossbowmen equipped in heavier armor to strike and defend positions under threat. Their crossbows too are a marked upgrade over the more simpler crossbows used by Skirmishers. Rhodok Sharpshooters differ from their Swadian counterparts by using a Rhodok style 'Board-Shield', making them far more able to recieve fire."
 rhodok_light_cavalry:0 "Rhodok Scouts"
 rhodok_light_cavalry_flavor:0 "Rhodoks do not typically field anything heavier than a tribesman on horse. These lightly armored skirmishing cavalry are called 'scouts'."
 rhodok_heavy_cavalry:0 "Rhodok Horsemen"
 rhodok_heavy_cavalry_flavor:0 "Rhodoks the horses with full armor are considered symbols of the tyrannic Swadian autocracy, and are thus considered sanctimonious by Rhodoks. Thus, the horseman, bearing nothing heavier than mail, are the only thing resembling heavy cavalry in Rhodokia."
 
 ## Rhoyd Troops ##
 rhoyd_light_infantry:0 "Rhoyd Volunteers"
 rhoyd_light_infantry_flavor:0 "The Rhoyds do not practice a levy or draft, instead calling on the free citizens of the land to come aide it in its time of need. The best amongst them form a specialized cadre of light infantry."
 rhoyd_heavy_infantry:0 "Rhoyd Tribal Warriors"
 rhoyd_heavy_infantry_flavor:0 "The Rhoyds from the less urban areas have a higher level of veterancy, and are often sponsored by mayors and elected officials with armor and weapons to help evade having to send any of their own family."
 rhoyd_pikemen:0 "Rhoyd Spearmen"
 rhoyd_pikemen_flavor:0 "With tribals filling the role of elite heavy infantry, veteran volunteers form into spear brigades, aiming to protect the younger volunteers, and the more experienced tribals."
 rhoyd_bowmen:0 "Rhoyd Tribal Archers"
 rhoyd_bowmen_flavor:0 "Rhody tribals often come to arms to help in defence of their lands, but without sponsorship, they often just utilize the Balion bow, something common in the tribes."
 rhoyd_crossbowmen:0 "Rhoyd Skirmishers"
 rhoyd_crossbowmen_flavor:0 "Rhoyds eagerly adopted the crossbow, and volunteers often arrived carrying their own personal crossbows, aiming to distinguish themselves from the Tribal bowmen. They are used as skirmishers, ducking from shield cover to shoot at enemies."
 rhoyd_light_cavalry:0 "Rhoyd Scouts"
 rhoyd_light_cavalry_flavor:0 "Rhoyds have historically never had access to the warhorses or armor that the other Balions used, instead their only cavalry consists of tribesmen on horseback."
 
 ## Kassen Troops ##
 kassen_light_infantry:0 "Kassen Volunteers"
 kassen_light_infantry_flavor:0 "The Kassen used to practice a form of judicial pacifism, their role as judges in all things given them a neutral stance with the other tribes. However, their emigration to Calradia forced a shift in this behavior, volunteers from migrant bands being drawn to help defend their people, evolving in the same being asked of peasants. The best amongst these peasants form a specialized cadre of light infantry."
 kassen_heavy_infantry:0 "Kassen Tribal Warriors"
 kassen_heavy_infantry_flavor:0 "The Kassen from the less urban territories, who never really practiced pacifism in any amount, are often sponsored by mayors and elected officials with armor and weapons to help evade having to send any of their own family."
 kassen_pikemen:0 "Kassen Spearmen"
 kassen_pikemen_flavor:0 "Kassen Volunteers who are forced to continue volunteering, often form into pike blocks, resembling what was once done with pitchfork in hand."
 kassen_bowmen:0 "Kassen Tribal Archers"
 kassen_bowmen_flavor:0 "Tribal Kassens use the bow that they inherited from Balion."
 kassen_crossbowmen:0 "Kassen Skirmishers"
 kassen_crossbowmen_flavor:0 "Crossbows are often seen as a more noble weapon by the Kassens, a superstition inherited from the Jendean view of the shiny, well armored Imperial crossbows. These crossbowmen are often used as skirmishers, retreating in and out of lines of infantry."
 kassen_light_cavalry:0 "Kassen Scouts"
 kassen_light_cavalry_flavor:0 "The Kassens, after their arrival on Calradia, found themselves merging into the local Jendean populations, a trend only reverted by Vlandian rule. This gave them the consistent experience of being lower on the pecking order, having thus a lack of heavier, more prestigious cavalry."
 
 ## Togerdi Troops ##
 togerd_light_infantry:0 "Togerdi Peregrins"
 togerd_light_infantry_flavor:0 "The Togerdi consider themselves above other groups of Balians, considering themselves the reciever of great truth. This inflated self opinion, has led their weakest of soldiers calling themselves 'Peregrins', as if to say that even their weakest soar above the other Balions soldiers."
 togerd_heavy_infantry:0 "Togerdi Auxilians"
 togerd_heavy_infantry_flavor:0 "Auxilians were once closely aligned Togerdi clans with the Imperials, now a mimicing of the old Imperial legionnaires. They fight in a similar manner to the legionnaire, differing only in their more stratified standards."
 togerd_pikemen:0 "Togerdi Pike Infantry"
 togerd_pikemen_flavor:0 "Togerdi pikemen are often far better equipped than their Northern Balion counterparts, considering themselves a cut above them, an equivalent to the old imperial 'infantry'."
 togerd_bowmen:0 "Togerdi Bowmen"
 togerd_bowmen_flavor:0 "The Togerdi view their usage of the bow to be equivalent to the Crossbow, holding them both to have been once used in more enlightened peoples."
 togerd_crossbowmen:0 "Togerdi Crossbowmen"
 togerd_crossbowmen_flavor:0 "The Togerdi crossbowmen is often used as as mercenaries by other powers, their expertise in the weapon proving a turning point in many conflicts."
 togerd_light_cavalry:0 "Togerdi Scouts"
 togerd_light_cavalry_flavor:0 "Togerdi utilize lightly armored cavalry, somewhat similar to that of the other Southern tribes, though they do not limit themselves to only light cavalry."
 togerd_heavy_cavalry:0 "Togerdi Heavy Horsemen"
 togerd_heavy_cavalry_flavor:0 "The Togerdi are unique in the southern tribes to utilize heavy cavalry, much in the style of the old Cataphract."
 
 ## Sudican Troops ##
 sudican_light_infantry_1:0 "Sudican Raiders"
 sudican_light_infantry_1_flavor:0 "Sudicans are often raiders by necessity, the bleakness of many islands forcing an economy built around raiding seasons."
 sudican_light_infantry_2:0 "Sudican Veteran Raiders"
 sudican_light_infantry_2_flavor:0 "The Sudican who raids to live is one man, the one who lives to raid is another. Veteran Raiders have armor of warriors, not villagemen, and weapons of steel, not just iron."

 sudican_bowmen_flavor:0 "Sudicans arm themselves with bows, their wars being most often against peasants and tribals, not well armored knights and nobles who need crossbows to pierce."
 sudican_light_cavalry:0 "Sudican Outriders"
 sudican_light_cavalry_flavor:0 "Outriders are landed Sudicans who have stolen horses, using them to enact devastating encirclements and flanking maneuvers."
 sudican_shock_infantry:0 "Sudican Shipbreakers"

 ## Eilander Troops ##
 eilander_light_infantry:0 "Eilander Footmen"
 eilander_light_infantry_flavor:0 "Eilanders only start to seperate units outside of the general levy at a higher level than many other Balion people in Calradia. These footmen are armed and armoured enough to sustan themselves more than a typical skirmisher."

 # Beni Zilal #

 zilal_light_infantry_flavor:0 "#F These promising men have walked the path of Zilal and are now considered Beni Zilal. Great skirmishers but cannot hold up in a fight.#!"
 zilal_light_cavalry:0 "Beni Zilal Horsemen"
 zilal_light_cavalry_flavor:0 "#F Trained by the Jawwal in ways of horsemenship, these Beni Zilal are nearly to par with their tribal counterparts but fail to do just as much damage.#!"

 zilal_heavy_cavalry_flavor:0 "#F Dedicating their lives to the Beni Zilal, these horsemen guard Zilal Fortress. Though not as tough as the Fāris, they can still lay waste to the battlefield.#!"
 # Eleftheroi #
 veteran_eleftheroi:0 "Eleftheroi Veterans"
 veteran_eleftheroi_flavor:0 "#F The Eleftheroi, the free people, live on the steppelands at the edge of the Empire. Originally the descendants of runaway slaves and debtors, they soon became highly valued by the local imperial commanders for their knowledge of this frontier zone.#!"
 # Bandits #
 ck_looters:0 "Looters" #Levies
 ck_looters_flavor:0 "Peasants who have turned to banditry often form into bands of looters, carrying whatever farming implements and tools they might have once used in their old lives as weapons of war. They make for a particularly ineffective fighting force, when put up against anything more than other peasants. Despite this, they have some value in their numbers, and ease of recruitment."
 ck_sea_raiders:0 "Sea Raiders" #HI
 ck_sea_raiders_flavor:0 "Sea Raiders are some of the most feared bandits in all of Calradia, they heil from the North, coming across the seas to raid and take plunder back. They typically form a heavier infantry than most other bandits, but they are still a lighter force than traditional heavy infantry."
 ck_taiga_bandits:0 "Taiga Bandits" #Skirm
 ck_taiga_bandits_flavor:0 "Hailing mostly from Dolinaks, the Taiga bandits often originate as resistance movements against what they see as a Nordic encroachment and colonization of their people. However, these movements often end up having to resort to banditry and acts of villainy to sustain their parties, leading them to become not much better than the oppressors they so often claim to fight."
 ck_forest_bandits:0 "Forest Bandits" #Archers
 ck_forest_bandits_flavor:0 "Balions took well to the crossbow, but that is the weapon of soldiers, of armies. Forest bandits often use the more simple, trusty longbow. Oftentimes a forest bandit might have once been a simple poacher, now on the run for that very same crime."
 ck_mountain_bandits:0 "Mountain Bandits" #Skirm
 ck_mountain_bandits_flavor:0 "In any mountainside in Calradia, one can often find mountain bandits. These hardy folk descend from lineages long forgotten, Battanians and Palaics alike, and from those who have taken to that lifestyle. They have a reputation for being adequate fighters, often making war in the same way their ancestors once did as freemen."
 ck_desert_bandits:0 "Desert Bandits" #LC
 ck_desert_bandits_flavor:0 "The vastness of the Southern deserts lends itself well to banditry. One can raid a village, then disappear into the desert as if a Jinn."
 ck_steppe_bandits:0 "Steppe Bandits" #HA
 ck_steppe_bandits_flavor:0 "The people of the steppes have not all taken well to the Khuzait's trend into becoming a settled people, with the Karakhergits perhaps being the most emblematic of the sort of people to refuse to abandon their old ways. Not all are Karakhergit, or rich enough to buy fine steed and make war as their ancestors did. These poorer nomads often resort to banditry, becoming a much feared sight across the steppes."

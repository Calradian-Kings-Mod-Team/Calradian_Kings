 surrani_religion_desc:1 "Zurran was the first God of man, when they were but spirits floating formlessly in nothingness, and he gave to them many blessings. First among them was a voice, to allow them to create the first music. This music, created by man with Zurran's blessing, reached harmony with the voices of the Gods to create the world, and it was then that Zurran, greatly pleased with the chorus that had been sung, gave to humanity bodies, so that they might live in and experience the great harmony that was sung by man and God.\n\nHowever, the Jinns, the spirits of those who had not accepted Zurran's gift of the voice, grew resentful, and locked Zurran in a box, the Sharazwa. The Jinns then took the Sharazwa, and hid it deep beyond the sands, where they guard it from the prying eyes of any who accepted the gifts of Zurran."

 kazyrdi_faith_adherent_plural:0 "Kazyrdists"
 kazyrdi_faith_desc: "The Kazyrdi evolved from the original priesthood of Zurran, and their religious leaders claim descent from the supposed first to accept the gifts of Zurran. Their religious practice takes the form of songs and chants, viewing the act of singing and making music to be the most holy thing one can do, for it was the chorus of all mankind with the Gods that created the world and so pleased Zurran as to gift those who sang bodies.\n\nDue to a belief that the Jinns hid the Sharazwa deep within a great desert, many a doomed expedition deep into deserts has been funded based on rumors of Jinns."

 azwatyz_adj: "Azwati"
 azwatyz_adherent: "Azwatan"
 azwatyz_adherent_plural: "Azwatans"
 azwatyz_desc: "The Azwati believe that the true location of the Sharazwa is on an island known only as Buyun, which lies far from the lands of men and is surrounded by a wall of thick storms, halting passage to all but the most experienced sailors. It is in this voyage to find the Sharazwa and the final freeing of Zurran, that the true goal and motivation of all true humans can be found.\n\nThe Azwati view sailing in a religious light, having numerous rituals and religious practices relating to the seas and ships. The many voyages of the Azwati are often accompanied by Zurriani ship-songs, in keeping with the tradition of the voice being the first gift of mankind. These ship-songs, combined with their tendency to make long voyages overseas, often mean the Azwati become troubadours and minstrels of renown throughout the world."
 
 hahmimnal:0 "Hahmim'nal"
 hahmimnal_adj:0 "Hahmim'nal"
 hahmimnal_adherent:0 "Follower of Musical Law"
 hahmimnal_adherent_plural:0 "Followers of Musical Law"
 hahmimnal_desc:0 "Rather than believing the Sharazwa to be physically hidden in the World, the Hahmim'nal believe it to be spiritually hidden within all of mankind. It is only through the recreation of the song of creation that Araz can be set free, to unleash a new paradise untold. The Hahmim'nal have adopted a labrynthian codex of musical rules and regulations, which often bleed into daily life. It is believed that each servant of Araz has a role to fulfill, and to act against that role is to bring disharmony to society, which will ultimately invite the Jinn to poison the minds of the faithful of Araz, bringing about the destruction of the harmony of the world. This belief has resulted in an extremely fundamentalist view of the world, with the Hamim'nal having little tolerance for anything perceived as acting against nature's harmony.\n\nThe mere act of singing out of tune within a Hahmim'nal community is often grounds for execution, and it has often been the case that rivals have been poisoned to hurt their voices, rather than their bodies. The cutting of the tongue is a punishment in Hahmim'nal reserved for the worst offenders, and it is believed that those whose tongues are cut become like the Jinn, unable to reach the state of Harmony doomed to a formless eternity.\n\nThe Hahmim'nal follow a unified set of rulings by the Court of the Law of Zurran, who decides all things related to musical law and religious theory. Though at times force to hide out of persecution, it always has existed in some form, according to the Hahmim'nal, since the very harmony of Zurran."

 palaic_religion_adherent_plural:0 "Asantilai"
 palaic_religion_adj:0 "Mekkiyados"
 palaic_religion_desc:0 "Though they remain culturally different in many ways, the Palaic people are united by a common overarching religion, $palaic_religion_adj$.\n\nPreaching the supremacy of the storm god, Ziparwa, and his thousands of companion gods, the Palaic religion is not unified under a single pantheon. Instead, different faiths emphasize the importance of various gods according to their cultural practices. Villages also conduct rites administered by local clergy, but there is currently no unified church within $palaic_religion_adj$. Despite the differences in faith, the religion as a whole is rather disorganized and more individualized."

 palaic_faith_amitatys_adj:0 "Kururiyad"
 palaic_faith_amitatys_adherent:0 "Kūrur"
 palaic_faith_amitatys_adherent_plural:0 "Kūrurza"
 palaic_faith_amitatys_desc:0 "The warrior faith of $palaic_faith_amitatys$ emphasizes the need for struggle before one can be considered worthy of Zaradas' blessing for peace. In a Kūrur's eyes, peace cannot be obtained without struggle. Without struggle, complacency takes root, giving the invader a chance to spread its insidious claws. By doing so, the invader can supplant faiths and cultures with its own.\n\nThe Palaics of Ametaris know this more than most, considering the near extinction of their faith and culture due to the invading Calradians. Though brutal in their methods of struggle, the Palaics of Ametaris do not commit human sacrifice, contrary to popular belief."

 palaic_faith_myzead_desc:0 "Peace, tradition, and democracy are the three fundamental pillars of the Taksulāi pantheon, headed by the god of the speechcraft, $palaic_memiya$. Through peace and diplomacy, the Myzadai were incorporated into the burgeoning Calradian Empire with little difficulty. Through negotiations, they were able to maintain their cultural and religious identity.\n\nHowever, the centuries have not been kind, and over time the Empire has encroached upon and subverted the Myzadai. Now, the only remnants of this ancient Palaic people are those who have escaped Calradization. Only time will tell if history will forget the Palaic people."

 palaic_faith_dryatic_adj:0 "Kalmarad"
 palaic_faith_dryatic_adherent:0 "Kalmarid"
 palaic_faith_dryatic_adherent_plural:0 "Kalmarids"
 palaic_faith_dryatic_desc:0 "The Kalmarids used to be numerous in the Dryatic region of Calradia. However, their numbers have diminished since the arrival of the Calradians from the west. In an effort to preserve their cultural and religious identity, they attempted a rebellion against their imperial overlords but failed miserably.\n\nThose who have not fallen to the Empire now live in mountain refuges, awaiting the day they can charge from the mountains to reclaim their land in the name of the mountain mother, Kalmara. The Kalmarids practice pilgrimages across the Dryatic Mountains to be closer to their mountain mother."

Spiritually influenced by the divine power and warmth of Azhuran, the Sun Father, these marabouts commune with the djinns that reside along mankind.\n\nDifferent marabouts have different methods of communion with these djinns, with some residing near mountaintops and volcanos, while other prefer to commune from the plains of Azrughen that stretch from the mountains of Adrar Amanai to the coastline of Ifni. In reality, most marabouts are political actors nowadays with their own motivations for power. Others still maintain the old ways. Meanwhile, migrations of people eastwards into the Nahasa proper have caused a diminishing of the religion overall as more and more take onto the teachings of Asera.\n\nCore to the Tamazigh people in the Prophecy of the Mahdi's Return. Generations ago, a great leader united and led the tribes to the east and north. They beat back Calradian and Nahrawi resistance until the death of their leader led to the collapse of their holy empire. It is then said that this leader will be reincarnated into a man, or woman, who follows the path paved by this leader in their conquests. Given the similarities to Asera and the path he himself wrote out for his followers, it is no wonder then many would leave the Tamazigh for the Aserai in the east."

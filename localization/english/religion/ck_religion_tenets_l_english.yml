 tenet_musicals_2_name:0 "First Gift of Zurran"

The composition of music and the arrangement of orchestras are highly ritualized affairs, with religious figures and scripture consulted for every chord and verse."

 tenet_religious_legal_pronouncements_zurr_desc:0 "Despite what might be expected out of a culture of music worshippers, Zurriani law often is labyrinthian, with various rulings and strict ordinances on how one can construct music, or conduct oneself as a ruler or person.

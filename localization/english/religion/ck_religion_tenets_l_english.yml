 # Zurrani
 tenet_musicals_2_name:0 "First Gift of Zurran"
 tenet_musicals_2_desc:0 "The Zurriani believe that Zurran gave voices to humanity so that they might sing. It was only through the songs old humanity sang that they were given body, and indeed that the world was created. Singing and making music continue to hold a place of prestige in Zurriani religion; where other religions might give sermons or preach, the Zurriani sing and hold concerts. The composition of music and the arrangement of orchestras are highly ritualized affairs, with religious figures and scripture consulted for every chord and verse."

To search for the Sharazwa is the one true mission of all humankind."

 calradian_religion_adherent_plural:1 "calradian"
 calradian_religion_desc:1 "$calradian_religion$ teaches that the first of the Vague God's mortal prophets, Calradios', was able to obtain Heaven's Mandate over the known world. The Vague God, themself, are named such due to their uniquely ambiguous nature. However, they are known for having created Heaven, guardian angels, mankind, and they also known for delivering Mandates to its most unique of creations.\n\nIn turn, Heaven's Mandate is a part political and part religious idea stating that those who show greatest favor with Heaven, and spread its teachings through conquest, are entitled to receive its divine mandate. Kings, Senators, and Emperors have all sought Heaven's Mandate to legitimize their short-lived rules, and only a few, in the total history of Calradia, have truly obtained Heaven's Mandate."

 # Vlandian Western Calradicism - Mix between old pagan traditions and updating them to be line with the Calradic Church (i.e. Insular Catholicism)
 western_calradic:0 "Wilundicism"
 western_calradic_adj:0 "Wilundist"
 western_calradic_desc:0 "The Wilundist faith is an intriguing blend of the ancient Calradian Mandate and the traditional customs of the Vlandian settlers who arrived in Calradia over the past few hundred years. Rooted in the traditions and legends of the diverse Vlandians, Wilundism honors Wilund the Bold, the legendary figure after whom the Vlandians are named, as a central saintly figure, intertwining his heroic deeds with the teachings of the Vague God.\n\nWilundism maintains the core belief in the Vague God, the ambiguous deity known for creating Heaven, guardian angels, and mankind, and for bestowing divine mandates. However, the faith diverges by incorporating [GetReligionByKey('balian_religion').GetAdjective] pagan customs, where revered ancestors and local heroes are venerated as saints, serving as intermediaries between the Vague God and the faithful."

 hetjur_desc:0 "The Ebor mountain range made proselytization by Calradic missionaries hard, and the Gottic people have syncretized many of their former pagan beliefs with those of the calradians. They have a focus on the veneration of great heroes, finding their clerical justification in the Calradic concept of saints, this veneration can at times approach outright worship. \n\nDeclared as heresy by the more mainstream Wilundics and Calradics alike, the faith is often seen as only slightly different from the pagan beliefs of old."

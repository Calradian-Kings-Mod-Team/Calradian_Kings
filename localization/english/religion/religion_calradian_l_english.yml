 calradian_religion_desc:1 "$calradian_religion$ teaches that the first of the Vague God's mortal prophets, Calradios', was able to obtain Heaven's Mandate over the known world. The Vague God, themself, are named such due to their uniquely ambiguous nature. However, they are known for having created Heaven, guardian angels, mankind, and they also known for delivering Mandates to its most unique of creations.\n\nIn turn, Heaven's Mandate is a part political and part religious idea stating that those who show greatest favor with Heaven, and spread its teachings through conquest, are entitled to receive its divine mandate. Kings, Senators, and Emperors have all sought Heaven's Mandate to legitimize their short-lived rules, and only a few, in the total history of Calradia, have truly obtained Heaven's Mandate."

 # Vlandian Western Calradicism - Mix between old pagan traditions and updating them to be line with the Calradic Church (i.e. Insular Catholicism)
 western_calradic:0 "Wilundicism"
 western_calradic_adj:0 "Wilundist"
 western_calradic_desc:0 "The Wilundist faith is an intriguing blend of the ancient Calradian Mandate and the traditional customs of the Vlandian settlers who arrived in Calradia over the past few hundred years. Rooted in the traditions and legends of the diverse Vlandians, Wilundism honors Wilund the Bold, the legendary figure after whom the Vlandians are named, as a central saintly figure, intertwining his heroic deeds with the teachings of the Vague God.\n\nWilundism maintains the core belief in the Vague God, the ambiguous deity known for creating Heaven, guardian angels, and mankind, and for bestowing divine mandates. However, the faith diverges by incorporating [GetReligionByKey('balian_religion').GetAdjective] pagan customs, where revered ancestors and local heroes are venerated as saints, serving as intermediaries between the Vague God and the faithful."

 hetjur:0 "Hetjurite"

 hetjur_desc:0 "The Ebor mountain range made proselytization by Calradic missionaries hard, and the Gottic people have syncretized many of their former pagan beliefs with those of the Calradians. They have a focus on the veneration of great heroes, finding their clerical justification in the Calradic concept of saints; this veneration can at times approach outright worship. They believe that Heaven's Mandate is awarded to the bold Saints who will one day make war with the Great Evil.\n\nDeclared as heresy by the more mainstream Wilundics and Calradics alike, the faith is often seen as only slightly different from the pagan beliefs of old."

However, full conversion under the imperial mandate would be stalled by the imperial civil war, leading to the converts adopting many Khyazgan traditions as their own. The concepts of Tenger and the Vague God were mixed, creating a view of the Vague God that holds them to not only be spiritually above the world in heaven, but also physically present above the Earth in the sky.\n\nIt is believed that through analyzing the movements of the stars in the sky, one can decipher the will of the Vague God."

They hold that Calradios, whilst an important prophet, was ultimately only human, and thus should not be held to the standards of infallibility, and indeed was capable of sin. This belief in Calradios being able to sin has led them to have a very confusing set of religious beliefs, with various prophets and priests each lending further differences to their religious dogma."

Aren was once a simple Kohayan farmer, however he would eventually come to witness nine miracles, through which he was shown the true nature of the Vague God. Because of this, Arenites believe that the Vague God is not so vague, referring to them as "Ahiy" instead"

 aekekartel:0 "Aekekartel"
 aekekartel_adj:0 "Aekekartel"
 aekekartel_desc:0 "The Aekekartel believe that Heaven's Mandate is not something shown through conquest, and the bulding of great empires. It is not something that grants one authority over the world either. Rather, the Heaven's Mandate is given to those who are good in life, and it is through the Heaven's Mandate that mortals can ascend into Heaven. Without attaining Heaven's Mandate, humans are stuck in an eternal cycle of reincarnation. This philosophy on the Mandate is known as Ascensionism.\n\nBelieving war to be a senseless evil, only serving as a distraction from achieving Heaven's Mandate to ascend, the Aekekartel adopt a pacifistic view on violence. Aekekartel Monks are known to subsist entirely off of the generousity of their fellows, and avoid hurting any other mortal being, at all costs. Though at one point practiced widely throughout the isles, the tightening of Imperial control, and the birth of the slave trade would gradually lead to the Aekekartel becoming only a minority throughout the islands, a relic of a time when the seas were a much more peaceful, indeed, better place."

 agreki:0 "Agreki"
 agreki_adj:0 "Agreki"
 agreki_desc:0 "Believing that the Vague God gives out Heaven's Mandate as a means to allow mortals into Heaven, rather than as a mandate of rule over the world, the Agreki emerged following the decline of the Aekekartel in the islands. They adopt a more pragmatic view of the world, and believe that though being a good person is necessary to achieve Heaven's Mandate, it is not necessary to completely avoid harming others, nor to avoid the pleasures of life. Indeed, to get Heaven's Mandate one must be a good human, and one who avoids conflict and joy cannot be said to be a good human.\n\nViewed by the Aekekartel as an excuse to allow slavery and other sins, the Agreki would gradually displace and overturn them as Imperial control led to increasing resistance. Face with a choice between a slow death at the hands of an Imperial magistrate, or a glorious death in battle to win a future for the islands, the Agreki swelled with converts from the Aekekartel."

 miraclist:0 "Miraclist"
 miraclist_adj:0 "Miraclist"
 miraclist_desc:0 "The pathway to Ascension through the Heaven's Mandate is found not through acts of good, but rather through the cultivation of one's self. Following the teachings of a Prophet known as Milappo, the Miraclists believe that through the cultivation of ones inner soul, one can attain the state of Mandated Miracle, where one achieves eternal life and many mystical powers. This cultivation is done through an esoteric mixture of varying rituals and clensing fasts, all requiring the aid of a dedicated priest. However, despite the eternal life given by the state of Mandated Miracle, it is considered to be pious to end ones life and ascend to Heaven once one's work on Earth is considered complete.\n\nAfterall, the Vague God is known to rescind the Mandate from those who do not choose to willingly enter into the gates of Heaven."

 krevmetiqstvo_desc:0 "When the Sturgics converted to the Calradic faith, the Empire had already been shattered. What was left was a force of monks, missionaries, and the Patriarchate, who would soon spread the Calradic religion across the North. Unable to keep the same dogma in a post-Imperial world, the religion adapted, drawing in elements of Sturgic culture, calling for honor, community, and dignity to be the three pillars of the faith.\n\nThe Heaven’s mandate is said to have been passed from Calradios to all the good and honorable among mankind, explaining how the Empire fell, whilst maintaining that it indeed had Heaven’s Mandate. In this, it is said that any realm, sufficiently sized, can have Heaven’s mandate to rule on the mortal world, though not the entirety of the world."

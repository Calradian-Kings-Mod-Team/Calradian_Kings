 balian_religion_desc:0 "Balion is home to a great number of differing faiths, all tied together by common threads. The most common of these threads is the reverence for the great warrior-king, Baerlon, who slew the great sea serpent Kalasrad. From the great serpent's body, which fell to the earth, came the isles of Balion, named after the man who slew the serpent and the people who now inhabit it.\n\nA great day is prophesied in where the great serpent will reconstitute itself only to be met by the chosen champion of Baerlon and the gods."

 massa_faith_desc:0 "Cemporges is a Balion faith commonly shared amongst the Massa peoples who followed Wilund the Bold into what is now southern Vlandia.\n\nTheir faith, in particular, preaches that one should remain committed to the law of conquest; those that rebel to your lawful conquest must be reminded of their insignificance in the face of those who are considered their better. Named after the Massan king, Cemporgas, whose brutal rule was a necessity in service to the Massan people whom he saved centuries ago."

 balian_religion:0 "Baerlonic"
 balian_religion_desc:0 "Balion is home to a great number of differing faiths, all tied together by common threads. The most common of these threads is the reverence for the great warrior-king, Baerlon, who slew the great sea serpent Kalasrad. From the great serpent's body, which fell to the earth, came the isles of Balion, named after the man who slew the serpent and the people who now inhabit it.\n\nA great day is prophesied in where the great serpent, Kalasrad, will reconstitute itself, at which time the Heroes will return to life, and begin a great war with Kalasrad and his followers.\n\nThe Balions left who practice the old ways are often marked by a refusal to accept Wilund the Bold as one of the Heroes, instead holding him to be an agent of Kalasrad or simply a great, though not divinely guided, mortal."

 massa_faith_desc:0 "Cemporges is a Balion faith commonly shared amongst the Massa peoples who followed Wilund the Bold into what is now southern Vlandia.\n\nTheir faith, in particular, preaches that Heroes should remain committed to the law of conquest; those that rebel to your lawful conquest must be reminded of their insignificance in the face of those who are considered their better. Named after the legendary Massan king, Cemporgas, whose brutal rule was a necessity in service to the Massan people whom he saved centuries ago."

 gottic_faith_adj:0 "Gottic"
 gottic_faith_desc:0 "The Gottic beliefs of the Gotts who have migrated to Calradia revolve around the Baerlonic concept of Heroes, the idea that there are certain divine warriors who manifest themselves into the mortal realm in mortal incarnations, and through great acts and conquest, they ascend beyond to join the war against the Great Demonic Serpent Kalasrad. The Gotts specifically hold onto a different set of Heroes than the other Baerlonics."

 rhoydak_faith_adj:0 "Rhoydak"
 rhoydak_faith_desc:0 "When the Balions intermingled with the native Jendea, they took many of their traditions as their own. Though still holding to the concept of divinely manifest Heroes, the Rhoydaks believe that not only the great conquerors and warriors are worthy of Heroes, but so too are those who protect nature and the wilds. To sacrifice yourself for the betterment of the natural world is something that is just as deserving of ascension. Afterall, after the great war with Kalasrad, the world will need to be retilled and resettled."

 wilundic_faith:0 "Baerlonic"
 wilundic_faith_adj:0 "Baerlonic"
 wilundic_faith_desc:0 "Baerlonic paganism was practiced by the Vlandians prior to their conversion to the Calradian faith. Through the faith's belief that certain Heroes can ascend to divinity and are divinely commanded, the faith would ultimately be subsumed entirely into the Calradian faith due to the conversion of Wilund the Bold, a man most shamans agreed was a Hero manifest. When the greatest Hero of the Balions said that the Heroes were not divine, but just saints, the belief of many was shattered.\n\nHowever, there exist those amongst the Vlandians and Balions who do not accept the ascension of Wilund, holding him to be an agent of Kalasrad, the Great Demonic Serpent. These followers, though few in number, are known as the Baerlonics, due to their holding of Baerlon above Wilund. They await a Hero to manifest and restore the true ways, before the end comes and Kalasrad devours an unready world."

 heasphof_faith_desc:0 "The Heáspheóf believe that Heroes are not divinely commanded, rather, any strong, devout Heáspheófic who accumulates enough wealth and glory can reach the status of Hero and ascend. Because of this difference, they believe that rather than war or great conquest, raiding and plundering is the path to ascending. Those who disagree with the Heáspheóf are seen as being either indirect servants of Kalasrad, or worse yet, willing slaves to the serpent.\n\nWhen Wilund the Bold came through to conquer Vlandia, the Heáspheóf took note of them as a great Hero. However, they do not believe that he was divinely guided, and therefore do not accept the Calradic faith."

 kalasradii_faith_adj:0 "Kalasradi"
 kalasradii_faith_desc:0 "The Kalasradi believe that when the world was young, the Divine Serpent-God, Kalasrad lived in the oceans, with humanity dwelling on their back. However, an evil mortal named Baerlon put Kalasrad to sleep in an act of trickery and betrayal. The foul Baerlon claimed that he had ascended beyond his mortality to become a 'Hero' after killing Kalasrad, but the Kalasradii know the truth, that Baerlon had tricked the Balions, and that Kalasrad was merely asleep.\n\nFaced by centuries, or even longer of persecution, the Kalasradi faith only survived through the immense effort of numerous cults to unify their belief systems in a text called the Næþrad. Despite this persecution, the Kalasradii tend to view their coreligonists as more misguided than evil, as it was only through the trickery of Baerlon that mortal man was induced to sin."

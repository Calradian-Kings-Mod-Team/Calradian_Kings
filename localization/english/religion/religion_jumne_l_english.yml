 jumne_religion:1 "Yörðic"
 jumne_religion_desc:1 "The Sagas of the natives of Jumne tell of a pantheon of Old, ancient Gods who hail from Yörð, a plane above our own, serving as celestial home to the Old Gods. Mortals, who dwell in the middle realm between Yörð and Vahaskka, must escape, and enter enter Vellahella, lest their souls be let fall by the Old Gods to Vahaskka and be consumed by Lopt, the swirling maw of death who dwells in that lower plane. So too must humans fear the witch Sybil, and the creator of the Middle Realm, Blainn, who seeks only to torture what he has created.\n\nThe Old Gods are said to be in perpetual war with Lopt and his servants, and only rescue those mortals who prove themselves Earth, in battle or in sacrifice, taking them to Vellahella, the mustering hall of the Gods. Chief amongst these Gods is Wodan, who guides the Gods in their holy duty."

 jumne_desc:1 "The followers of the Old Gods, as the faith of the Nords is known to Calradia, believe in a pantheon of ancient Gods, led by the Godsking Wodan. Bjorn, Njörðr, Freyja, Týr are chief amongst the family of the Godsking, and it is common to place one of these Gods, or Wodan himself, ahead of the others as their Ward-God, so as to better beseech that God to watch and help guide their path to Vellahella."

 old_jumne_desc:0 "The faith of old Jumne differs from that of the Calradian Nords. Those Nords of more warlike creed tended to migrate south, leaving Jumne for greener pastures. Instead of concerning themselves with war, the Old Jumnics practice the construction of great megaliths to please the Olds Gods, who desire artisans and warriors alike to serve in Vellahella."

But this does not mean they value women above men, rather, they hold people who live closest to Freyja's example to be the most likely to ascend to Vellahella. They value the singer and the skald above the warrior."

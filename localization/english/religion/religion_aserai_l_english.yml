The Aserai differ from other Nahasan religions in their belief in the teachings and struggle of $aserai_good_god_asera$, from whom they claim descendance.\n\nIt is in $aserai_good_god_asera$'s teachings that the Aserai find in their hearts a sense of community and shared burden to find the next path for the Aserai to follow.\n\nOn the other hand, there remains a superstitious belief in the spirits of the Nahasan Desert, jinns, a belief shared amongst other Nahasan faiths. These jinns may cause mischief and punish those who fail to follow the path laid out by Asera."

Differing from their predecessor faith, [GetFaithByKey('aserai_faith').GetName], the $sarranid_faith_adherent_plural$ believe in one true God, the Calradic Vague God. However, God's true purpose and intent for this world is not truly 'vague', and therefore anyone who claims that God has a vague nature truly does not know themself. They believe that God sent forth a prophet from the south to bring the Aserai into a new golden age.\n\nWith ties to the Calradic concept of Heaven, Ardallah is closer in nature with #l [GetReligionByKey('calradian_religion').GetAdjective] Mandate#! than its native cousins thanks to the proselytization efforts of [GetFaithByKey('ember_flame').GetAdjective]. The $sarranid_faith_adherent_plural$ prostrate themselves before the wisdom and glory of God to be considered worthy of His divine mandates. It is the holiest of duties then for the children of Asera to not only deliver to God the lands of the Calradians, promised to them by Asera himself, but uphold the core tenets of their faith to be considered worthy of holding the title of Khalīfah.\n\nHowever, the one truth present amongst all of God's children is that Asera was their first chosen prophet, and Darusos was their last prophet on this world."

 CK_GLOSS_ANBAY:0 "Anbay is the $jawwal_faith_adj$ form of the Nahasan god, Ammerah, albeit with some differences. Anbay is the husband of the fertility goddess, $aserai_fertility_god_name$, and father of the gods $aserai_wealth_god_name$, $aserai_water_god_name$, $aserai_witchgodname$, and $aserai_night_god_name$.\n\nIn [GetFaithByKey('jawwal_faith').GetAdjectiveNoTooltip|U] oral traditions, Asera is said to have been birthed from Anbay in the oasis of Sahel, and is therefore considered a child of the gods."

This practice is known as the Nudhir'oustar.\n\nHowever, after $aserai_good_god_asera$'s death, their true words would be distorted by greedy Ulama, and it is because of this that any centralized Ulamate cannot be trusted, and will always fall to corruption."

Treating others with respect, listening to the words of another, and living a life free of immoral temptation are said to please and even draw the respect of jinns, given their connection to Ammerah.\n\nHowever, it is also said that those who deviate from the path set by Ammerah and his prophets, like Asera, are cursed with possession by the evilest of jinns because of their impure heart. Those possessed by these jinns are forever banished until they can exorcise the being from their heart and mind, at which point they may return to their tribe."

They interpret Asera's journey as proof that submission to fate is the only way to attain peace and harmony. Unlike other Aserai sects, they do not seek conquest or struggle, but instead embrace a lifestyle of contemplation, patience, and acceptance. Qadirits are known for their ascetic ways, often living as hermits in the desert, trusting that whatever happens is the will of the divine."

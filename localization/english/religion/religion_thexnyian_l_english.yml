 thexnyian_pagan_desc:0 "An ancient polytheistic religion once common across the Perassic, the adherents of this faith worshiped a wide variety of patron gods, each overseeing different aspects of life. Upon reaching the age of twenty, adherents would choose a patron god to serve for life, with devotion ranging from daily prayers to complete dedication to a temple. The Lotkians, in particular, chose Korythos, their god of war, as their primary deity. Alixenus 'the Great', legendary Lotkian ruler, built temples to Korythos across his vast empire, stretching from the Perassic to the distant lands of the Ghatani. According to legend, the Thexnyian Gods resided in the lost city of Thexnyia, destroyed in a titanic war.\n\nDespite surviving into the Calradian Republic, the faith eventually diminished with the rise of the Calradic Mandate, leading to its near extinction by the time of the Calradian Empire."

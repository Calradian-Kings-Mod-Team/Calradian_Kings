Originally coming from the burgher class of society in the more urbanized centers of the former western Calradian Empire, however, the landed nobility of Vlandia took issue with the foreign burghers being allowed to dominate such places in society, and they pushed the Bithics out of the cities into the countryside."

 pamphian_desc:0 "#size:15    The Province of Pamphia has at times been the most wealthy of the Empire, controlling trade from the West and South, and was the location of some of the first Imperial colonies. This immense wealth gradually centralized into the city of Charas and the Western province, leading to a distinct culture that places a high value on trade. So too was the area often granted considerable autonomy under the Calradian Empire.\n\nAfter the Togerdi arrived in the Balion migrations, many Pamphians would intermarry and assimilate, creating a new Southern melting pit. After decades of this assimilation, true Pamphian culture only survives in coastal villages and towns, a farcry from the immense wealth and prestige of old."

The rugged terrain breeds a hardy people, who did not have to rely much on the Nords for protection, or as mercenaries, for the wildlands and mountains provided the protection they needed. Instead, they increasingly became more and more isolated, and only break their isolation when they wish to trade their furs and wood to local settlements.\n\nDue to this unrest, Nords often avoided the area, instead settling the coasts and peninsulas, leading to the Dolinak increasingly diverging from their Sturgic Ancestors."

They would suffer constant raids from the men of the steppes, and would ally with the local Sturgics, together facing off against many a Great Khan, and at times falling to them as well. Many Tyalor will boast that the blood of many great steppe conquerors flow through their veins.\n\nThe isolation from the rest of Sturgia has led the Tyalor to adopt many differing traditions from their Western kin, with intermarriages with the local steppe peoples commonplace. Many within the principality consider Tyal to have the potential to finally end hereditary rule in Sturgia, or perhaps create something new all together."

The Nords from Jumne would come down often, but full-fledged settlement only massively started after the north glaciers began to make their way inland, making Jumne increasingly colder for habitation. The Nords initially tried to conquer the area but were repulsed by a combined force of Sturgics and Chertygics. These groups of Sturgics would then increasingly hire Nords as mercenaries, and in some cases even elect them princes of their cities, beginning a process of marrying the customs of Nord and Sturgic together.\n\nThe first Grand Prince of Sturgia was elected under pressure from the expanding Calradian Empire, with the title later becoming hereditary, as the Sturgics, Chertygics, and Nords increasingly intermarried to create the Sturgians."

King Enniaun of the Rhennod Battanians, in ages long past, fought and defeated encroaching Calradian legions at the pass of Nomar by successfully collapsing the sheer cliffs onto the imperials. This decisive battle destroyed a full Calradian legion, but it also isolated the Rhennods from their Llyn Tywal brethren. In turn, they had to endure decimation from the enraged Calradians, and later the invading Vlandians. Now they inhabit the same mountain range they fought that historic battle at, and occasionally make treacherous treks across them to trade with their inland cousins.\n\nThese centuries of cultural isolation have driven the Rhennods into an arboreal life among the forests and mountains bandits."

When the Vlandians assumed full control of the west from the Calradians under Osric “Iron-Arm”, the Togerdi had assimilated into the local Calradian population, marrying the traditions of the bureaucratic Calradians and the militarist Togerdi.

They eventually migrated northwards into the Morcomb Valley, intermingling with the local Battanians there.\n\nDeclaring themselves rulers of those lands, they stubbornly held back the advances of Calradian legions who sought to dislodge the upstarts. However, the region’s mountainous terrain gave the Vorgotts immense tactical leverage against the heavier Calradian armies. The Empire pulled out of the region, leaving the Vorgotts to mind their own business to create a thriving logging industry and trade with the Sturgians and Battanians.\n\nEventually, the Vlandians would make landfall on the continent.

The hill in question is Serteau Hill, northwest of Caleus.\n\nThe Saurgotts, along with the Vorgotts and Marrmann, were forced from their ancestral homes and into Calradia. Long before the Vorgotts migrated to the north, the Saurgotts had already made the north their home. Offering their labor in exchange for land from the Calradians, the Saurgotts made homes in the north in exchange for lumbering to be sent to the Empire. They both traded with and held off raids from Battanians, Nords, and Sturgians alike for decades creating a unique community of Balionians, Battanians, Nords, and Sturgics.\n\nEventually, the Vlandians would make landfall on the continent and the Saurgotts would lose a vital trading partner.

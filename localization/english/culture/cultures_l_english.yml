Initially used as a thuggish arm of the empire, they would soon prove they were not to be taken advantage of when a Jalmaryan general named Carsos staged a military coup. After this coup, they went from thickly accented thugs looked down upon by the rest of the Empire, to thickly accented thugs who were not to be treated lightly.\n\nThis history of military revolt and acting as thugs would lead to martial skills being highly valued in Jalmaryan culture. Service in the legions is seen as something to aspire to, though once in the legions they often find themselves treated as brutes, and are considered by many of the High Calradians to have more in common with the Vulgars, than any proper High Calradic."

Around 500 A.C., during the early days of the Calradian Empire, the first Calradians to arrive in the region were independent traders, transporting goods between the city-states along Lake Tanaesis and back to Imperial holdings further west.\n\nAs the Empire expanded, the traders' independence waned, and many chose to settle permanently in the region. Over time, the Empire secured key trade routes and brought the city-states under its control as imperial tributaries.

However, the region’s mountainous terrain gave the Vorgotts immense tactical leverage against the heavier Calradian armies. The Empire pulled out of the region, leaving the Vorgotts to mind their own business to create a thriving logging industry and trade with the Sturgians and Battanians.\n\nEventually, the Vlandians would make landfall on the continent.

Long before the Vorgotts migrated to the north, the Saurgotts had already made the north their home. Offering their labor in exchange for land from the Calradians, the Saurgotts made homes in the north in exchange for lumbering to be sent to the Empire. They both traded with and held off raids from Battanians, Nords, and Sturgians alike for decades creating a unique community of Balionians, Battanians, Nords, and Sturgics.\n\nEventually, the Vlandians would make landfall on the continent and the Saurgotts would lose a vital trading partner.

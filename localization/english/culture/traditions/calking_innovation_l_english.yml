 innovation_swadian_settling_desc: "Our humiliating defeat against the Rhodoks in their insurrection has driven our people into further infighting. Growing tired and weary of the infighting that caused the civil war, the Swadian monarchy has decreed that all good Swadians should work towards a collective goal of conquest against the barbarians to the east — the Battanians.\n\nWhile the goals of these expansions were intended to reduce further infighting and direct warfare outwards, this mandate from the monarchy has also helped to solidfy weakned familial bonds, and even helped to mend bad blood between older Swadian families."

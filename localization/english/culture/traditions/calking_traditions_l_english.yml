 tradition_disloyal_vaegirs_desc:0 "For generations, the people of the north were nothing more than a swath of independent kingdoms. However, the arrival of the Calradians into the north spawned a need to unite under an elected Prince; one who would lead their people into war against their enemies.\n\nEventually the princes became a hereditary office, and this has never sat well with the many independence-minded Boyars. While some chafe at the idea of a monarchy, others are more amenable to returning to an elected Prince."

 tradition_battanian_unity_name:0 "Batha Am Bràth"
 tradition_battanian_unity_desc:0 "The Battanians have been fighting a battle against all their neighbors for centuries. This extreme state of their culture, in a state of constant threat, as if a candle in the wind, has led many Battanians to be willing to set aside minor differences in faith and culture between their brethren, and work together, to try and make a future where Battanians do not need to fear slavery or oppression. Of course, viewing other cultures as oppressors and hostile forces seeking to undermine Battania has led to the Battanians developing a rather isolationist outlook.

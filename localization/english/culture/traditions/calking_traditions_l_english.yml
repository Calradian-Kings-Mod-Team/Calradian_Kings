 tradition_disloyal_vaegirs_desc:0 "For generations, the people of the north were nothing more than a swath of independent kingdoms. However, the arrival of the Calradians into the north spawned a need to unite under an elected Prince; one who would lead their people into war against their enemies.\n\nEventually the princes became a hereditary office, and this has never sat well with the many independence-minded Boyars. While some chafe at the idea of a monarchy, others are more amenable to returning to an elected Prince."

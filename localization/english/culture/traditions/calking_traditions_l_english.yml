 tradition_disloyal_vaegirs_name:0 "Boyar Autonomy"
 tradition_disloyal_vaegirs_desc:0 "For generations, the people of the north were nothing more than a swath of independent kingdoms. However, the arrival of the Calradians into the north spawned a need to unite under an elected Prince; one who would lead their people into war against their enemies.\n\nEventually the princes became a hereditary office, and this has never sat well with the many independence-minded Boyars. While some chafe at the idea of a monarchy, others are more amenable to returning to an elected Prince."

 tradition_battanian_unity_name:0 "Batha Am Bràth"
 tradition_battanian_unity_desc:0 "The Battanians have been fighting a battle against all their neighbors for centuries.

Of course, viewing other cultures as oppressors and hostile forces seeking to undermine Battania has led to the Battanians developing a rather isolationist outlook."

 tradition_vulgar_calradic_name:0 "Vulgar Calradic"
 tradition_vulgar_calradic_desc:0 "Vulgar Calradians originate from the intermingling of Calradic settlers with local, native populations. Despite this mixed heritage, they often still view themselves as imperial, if not more imperial than any High Calradian. They speak various regional dialects of Calradic, which are oftentimes mutually unintelligible. However, there exists a dialectical continuum, wherein areas close to each other can understand each other. This, combined with the more well-off and influential amongst them learning High Calradic, has led to a unity in the Empire that is not seen anywhere else in Calradia.\n\n The vast bulk of the Empire's military is drawn from the commonfolk of Calradia, with many joining for a chance to acquire land for their families from the various wars that the Heaven’s Mandate necessitates. Those who do not leave their homelands, however, tend to be strong, contented folk, who are happy to stay and never see an imperial official in their lives."

They often form the bulk of the Empire’s elite troops, with connections and money for their equipment ensuring they end up in a privileged position.\n\n Formed mostly from settlers from the core of the Empire, High Calradians speak a general tongue that is, for the most part, mutually intelligible with other forms of High Calradic. However, the local, common tongue of Calradic is also frequently spoken among the commoners and could replace it should the empire pass into history."

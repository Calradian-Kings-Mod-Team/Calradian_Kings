The rich oligarchic families would send their sons to this school with the expectation that they would learn the proper ways to govern. Some of the more ambitious families would hope that this education would give their sons a leg up towards becoming emperors themselves.\n\nWomen were historically excluded from the institution, but the liberalization of the institution has paved the way for women to obtain an education just as their brothers would. Rhagaea, Lucon, and Jastion Neretzes are some of the most notable alumni of the academy."

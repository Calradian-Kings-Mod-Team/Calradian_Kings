The shock of his sudden death sent a cataclysmic shockwave through the teetering empire. Lines drawn over the past decades finally gave way to a splintering of the Empire into three.\n\nRhagaea leads the southern Calradian Empire in a bid to continue a tradition of dynastic leadership in her new empire.

After two decades of rule, the Neretzes and Osticos families, with help from a dissident Dryatic, were able to overthrow the barbarian kingdom.\n\nUnfortanately, the land never went back to the Serapides.

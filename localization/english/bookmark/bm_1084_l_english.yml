 bm_1084_aserai_bookmark_banu_qaraz_desc: "Handsome, strong, and intelligent, Emir Suruq seems to have it all, but appearances can be deceiving. This fortune-builder is in over his head, as the city of Iyakis is infiltrated by the Beni Zilal, a cult of religious fanatics.\n\n#bold Will Suruq convert, joining the Old Man of the Mountain, or will he crush the cult, preserving peace against their covert machinations?#!"

Banu Qild stands against Banu Sarran in a blood feud over Tais’ execution of a Sarran tribesman on the charge of adultery. It is the duty of this learned emir to uphold the law, and by any means necessary, he will protect himself and his house from Sarran vengeance, destroying them if he must.\n\n#bold With enemies to the north and a growing discontent with the Sultan, will Tais' family fulfill their own growing ambitions, or will they become crushed under the weight of those ambitions?#!"

 bm_1084_aserai_bookmark_banu_ruwaid_desc: "Deceitful and paranoid, Emir Aqar of Barihal, leader of Banu Ruwaid, is known simply as an “elusive shadow.” He wields power over the western courts of the Aserai Sultanate with subtlety and cunning, a bribe here, a threat there, all for the greater good of his house and his Sultan, Unqid.\n\n#bold One of the Sultan’s most trusted councillors, will he abuse this position to aggrandize himself, or act from the shadows to protect Unqid from plotting vassals?#!"

Emir Adram is seen as a just ruler by his people, and it is because of this sense of justice that he feuds with Banu Qild. Nimr Sarran, Adram’s brother, was executed for adultery by order of Emir Tais.

 ## Battania 1084 Bookmark ##
 bm_1084_battania: "The High Kingdom"
 bm_1084_battania_desc: "From time immemorial, there has been a High King of Battania, crowned with great ceremony on the sacred hill of Dunthanach. But ask any Battanian chieftain whose kingdom he rules, and he will glance over his hall, his fields, his pastures, his flock, and his retainers before answering, "Mine, of course."\n\nOnly recently, following the example of the Empire, have the High Kings attempted to exert real authority. "Such unruly cattle as my people require a strong herdsman's hand to steer them from the ravine and protect them from the wolf," declared one such ruler, just before a jealous cousin betrayed him, delivering him in chains to the nearest imperial outpost.\n\nThe misty hills of north-western Calradia are home to the Battanian clans, the original inhabitants of much of the continent. Their hilltop fortresses have borne witness to countless wars, as they have fought fiercely to resist outside invaders: first the legions of the Empire, and more recently, the rising kingdoms of Sturgia and Vlandia. They are masters of the longbow, the night raid, and the sudden, wild charge from the depths of the forest. They idolize valour, especially when laced with mischief. A cattle thief who can vanish into the fog with an entire herd is celebrated; a champion who dines with a rival tribe and, while regaling his hosts with a tale of battle, produces the skull of one of their fallen kinsmen as a souvenir is remembered in song."

 # Derngil #
 bm_derngil: "Mormaer Ergeon"
 bm_derngil_desc: "Mormaer Ergeon of fen Derngil, lord of Dunglanys and Aster Castle, walks the fine line between honour and ambition, duty and resentment. Brother to the vanished High King Aeril, he stands as the last great name of his line, the only man with a rightful claim to Battania’s throne. Yet he does not press it. His clan whispers of Caladog’s lowborn blood, of treachery and vanished kings, but Ergeon bids them to hold their tongues. The fen Derngils have always stood for a strong monarchy, and he will not see Battania torn apart by feuds and pretenders.\n\nHonest, cautious, and ever measured, he is known as a man of decency in a realm where such traits often go unrewarded. He does not rush headlong into battle, instead he seeks peace where it can be made, mercy where it can be afforded, and strength where it is required. \n\n#bold There are those who say he is too cautious, that a man with his name should seize his birthright. But Ergeon will see Battania endure, no matter what it costs him.#!"
 # Uvain #
 bm_uvain: "Mormaer Melidir"
 bm_uvain_desc: "Mormaer Melidir, leader of Clan fen Uvain, is a man of sharp wit and sharper tongue, known as much for his cleverness as for his roguish nature. Where others in Battania are driven by blood feuds and battle cries, Melidir weighs the cost of war in quieter moments, seeing not just the glory of victory but the price paid in its pursuit. He is no stranger to ambition, yet he tempers it with cynicism, ever questioning the wisdom of his people’s endless struggles.\n\nPragmatic yet disillusioned, he wonders what Battania has truly gained from its wars. The Sturgians and Vlandians hate them worse than ever. The Empire lies shattered, but what good is that if Battania itself remains surrounded, its enemies sharpening their blades?\n\n#bold A man of strategy rather than sentiment, Melidir believes war should serve a purpose, but in that belief, will he find himself in the minority?#!"
 # Morcar #
 bm_morcar: "Mormaer Pryndor"
 bm_morcar_desc: "A giant among men, Mormaer Pryndor of Caerlanoc towers over friend and foe alike, a living force of nature. A zealot of Battanian Druidism, he does not simply follow the old ways, he enforces them. With bloodied fists and an unshaken will, he defends the sacred lands of Battania, barring the Calradian Empire from the mountain passes they so desperately seek to claim.\n\nThe Imperials march, their legions pressing forward, yet time and time again, they break against Pryndor. Not through cunning or trickery, but through sheer, unrelenting strength, his hulking form stands like a wall, his warbands striking with savage fury. To his people, he is a guardian, a chosen hand of the gods. To his enemies, he is a nightmare in the flesh.\n\n#bold He will spread his faith as he spreads his rule, with raw, unshaken force. The Western Empire of Garios may come, but so long as Pryndor stands, they will go no further.#!"

Honourable in word, fair in judgment, and steady in command, he stands apart from the feuds and ambitions that so often divide the realm. His clan, fen Penraic, is small, consisting only of himself and his cousin, Fenagan, yet his influence reaches far beyond his household.\n\nA man without controversy, content with his station and uninterested in grasping for greater power, there are those who look upon the reign of High King Caladog with discontent, and in hushed voices, they speak of Luichan, not as a rival, but as a rightful king.\n\n#bold In Battania, the wind changes quickly, and even the most steadfast of men can be carried with the storm. Though Luichan cares little for power, will that ultimately change?#!"
 bm_penraic_2: "Mormaer Fenagan"
 bm_penraic_2_desc: "Mormaer Fenagan is the younger cousin of Mormaer Luichan, leader of Clan fen Penraic. His fief sits between two Sturgian strongholds, its walls standing firm against the northern tide. A warrior by nature, Fenagan relishes the fight, driving back invaders with fire and fury, his warbands striking deep into enemy lands; his ambitions stretch beyond mere battle.\n\nHe does not intend to live forever in his cousin's shadow. Let Luichan lead the clan, for now. A stronger hand is needed, one unafraid to seize what is owed. And if the chance presents itself, Fenagan will take it.\n\n#bold As Fenagan, will you successfully bide your time and take your cousin's land, or will the northern menace come crashing to your shores?#!"
 # Giall #
 bm_giall: "Mormaer Aeron"
 bm_giall_desc: "Mormaer Aeron of fen Giall rules from Pen Cannoc and Ab Comer Castle, but his true domain is that of chaos. He is a man of wild passions - generous one moment, ruthless the next. Some call him bold, others call him reckless. Many call him mad. But no one would dare call him weak.\n\nImpulsive and daring, Aeron leads from the front, laughing as he rides into battle, his axe drinking deep. His enemies curse his cruelty, his allies endure his schemes, yet none can deny his skill in warfare. To those he favours, he is open-handed and loyal; to those who cross him, he is merciless. He takes what he wants and leaves the rest to burn.\n\n#bold He is a force of nature, feared and admired in equal measure. Some say he will lead fen Giall to ruin, others that he will carve his name into history with blood and fire. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain, Aeron does not ask for permission. He takes.#!"
 # Eingal #
 bm_eingal: "Mormaer Aradwyr"
 bm_eingal_desc: "Mormaer Aradwyr of fen Eingal rules from Druimmor Castle, a Battanian stronghold on the Vlandian frontier. The knights of Vlandia test his resolve, and raiders from Ocs Hall scour his lands, yet the knot of Eingal still flies proudly above Druimmor’s ramparts.\n\nCautious, yet devious, Aradwyr prefers schemes to battle, a preference that sets him apart from his fellow Mormaers. Where others charge headlong into the fray, he waits, plans, and strikes only when the moment is right. It is no secret that he is a schemer, yet, rumours circulate that beneath the cunning lies a soft heart.\n\n#bold To his west lies the bloodhounds of Vlandia. As Aradwyr, can your scheming save you from an inevitable clash with the Vlandian nobility?#!"
 # Caernacht #
 bm_caer: "Mormaeress Maireas"
 bm_caer_desc: "Mormaeress Maireas of Etir moves unseen, a whisper in the dark, a knife in the ribs. In her youth, she was a seductress; now, she is something far more dangerous. A schemer to the core, she weaves plots with the same ease that others draw breath, her ambitions limitless, her patience boundless.\n\nShe is of the Etirwyn, a people who claim to be the truest of Battanians, the eldest blood, the last unbroken line. They have resisted Imperial conquest, Vlandian invasion, and time itself. Maireas holds that legacy close, but she does not waste herself in sentiment. Power is her only loyalty, and she will do anything to secure it, kill anyone, destroy anything, climb as high as she can while ensuring her enemies fall further still.\n\n#bold To those who do not know her, she is a ghost, the unseen hand that bends fate to her will. To those who cross her, she is something far worse. Mormaeress Maireas does not fight battles. She ends them before her enemies know they have begun.#!"
 bm_gruffendoc: "Mormaer Muinser" # Gruffendoc
 bm_gruffendoc_desc: "Mormaer Muinser of Myr, an old soldier turned diplomat, has spent a lifetime waging war on Battania’s frontier. In his youth, he fought shoulder to shoulder with his cousin, High King Caladog, mastering the art of war in the deep forests and shadowed glens. His name is known across Calradia, spoken with respect, or fear, for his skill in woodland combat. For years, he has stood as the shield of the East, holding the line against legions and raiders.\n\nA widower, Muinser’s heart hardened the day his wife fell to an Imperial raid. From that moment, his war became personal. To that end, he speaks with the Sturgians and Palaics not as enemies, but as useful hands to keep at bay, securing peace with them so that he and his Fianns might strike ever deeper into Imperial lands.\n\n#bold Age has not dulled his blade, nor his resolve. Where others seek glory, Muinser seeks vengeance. The old wolf of Myr will have his due. #!"
 ## Sturgia 1084 Bookmark ##
 bm_1084_sturgia: "The Grand Principality"
 bm_1084_sturgia_desc: "The north is a land with countless centuries of history ranging back long before the Empire. The hardy Sturgians and their cultural cousins make this cold land their home. When the Empire did come, it found a divided frontier ripe with resources and willing mercenaries for its many campaigns. When the Calradians began to meddle in the affairs of the Sturgians though, the Empire found itself in a situation it feared: the unification of the Sturgians.\n\nThe unification of the Princes and Boyars into a Grand Principality gave common cause to every man, woman, and child across the north. No longer were they fighting against each other in petty squabbles; they all now had a common enemy: the Calradian Empire. For the next few centuries, Sturgia managed to hold off Calradian campaigns into their land, and even as the two empires aged, their relations never truly settled into peace.\n\nToday, Sturgia is led by Grand Prince Raganvad, son of the slain Vadinslav. Raganvad's own grip on power is maintained through punishment of insubordination and military force. To many of the Boyars, they see the hereditary rule of the Gundarovings as being antithetical to the idea of a Grand Principality. Some of those Boyars strive for true independence, but others see an alternative where the office of Grand Prince becomes an electable position rather than a hereditary one."

The Grand Prince's method of ruling has very little to do with justice and fairness, and has more to do with punishment and fear. This view on rulership is a stark contrast against his late father, Vadinslav, who perished in the Battle of Pendraic.\n\nEven though Raganvad puts his boot down on unrest, the Boyars nevertheless scheme and toil for liberty from the Grand Prince.\n\n#bold As Raganvad, will your method of leading lead to ultimate doom for the Grand Principality, or will you successfully utilize your familial connection to the Nords in order to quench any rebellion?#!"

A land of deep tradition founded upon its Balionic roots, Vlandia has a long history on the continent of Calradia.\n\nNamed after the warlord, Wilund the Bold, Valandion in Calradic, they have also brought over their faith to the continent and syncretized it to the core beliefs of the Calradic Mandate system. Today, Vlandia exists as a multicultural land with differing faiths dispersed throughout it. In addition to that fact, cultural divides have been growing over the past few centuries.\n\nEver since the first landing by Wilund, those who followed after have been relegated to the lowest stratum of Vlandian society. A group of people can only take so much before the rift stays open for good, and the Vlandians must be mindful of their south — for the differences there are reaching a tipping point."

 ## Sturgia 1084 Bookmark ##
 bm_1084_sturgia: "The Grand Principality"
 bm_1084_sturgia_desc: "The north is a land with countless centuries of history ranging back long before the Empire. The hardy Sturgians and their cultural cousins make this cold land their home. When the Empire did come, it found a divided frontier ripe with resources and willing mercenaries for its many campaigns. When the Calradians began to meddle in the affairs of the Sturgians though, the Empire found itself in a situation it feared: the unification of the Sturgians.\n\nThe unification of the Princes and Boyars into a Grand Principality gave common cause to every man, woman, and child across the north. No longer were they fighting against each other in petty squabbles; they all now had a common enemy: the Calradian Empire. For the next few centuries, Sturgia managed to hold off Calradian campaigns into their land, and even as the two empires aged, their relations never truly settled into peace.\n\nToday, Sturgia is led by Grand Prince Raganvad, son of the slain Vadinslav. Raganvad's own grip on power is maintained through punishment of insubordination and military force. To many of the Boyars, they see the hereditary rule of the Gundarovings as being antithetical to the idea of a Grand Principality. Some of those Boyars strive for true independence, but others see an alternative where the office of Grand Prince becomes an electable position rather than a hereditary one."
 # Gundaroving #
 1084_raganvad_2: "Grand Prince Raganvad"
 1084_raganvad_2_desc: "Stern and unyielding. Raganvad has only been Grand Prince for seven years, and already, the seams of the Grand Principality are seemingly apparating and growing into deep divides. The Grand Prince's method of ruling has very little to do with justice and fairness, and has more to do with punishment and fear. This view on rulership is a stark contrast against his late father, Vadinslav, who perished in the Battle of Pendraic.\n\nEven though Raganvad puts his boot down on unrest, the Boyars nevertheless scheme and toil for liberty from the Grand Prince.\n\n#bold As Raganvad, will your method of leading lead to ultimate doom for the Grand Principality, or will you successfully utilize your familial connection to the Nords in order to quench any rebellion?#!"

 bm_sturgia_godun_desc: "Godun is everything a prince might want: cooperative, prompt to pay his feudal dues, quick to respond to his liege's calls to arms. However, the Grand Prince maintains an air of caution and skepticism towards the Vagirovings. To Raganvad, it is hard to imagine Godun not having long-term plans.\n\nAs for Godun, himself, he worries more about the marauding Khuzic tribes to his east, as well as the occasional Nordic raider from the north. Lek, Godun's son and heir, is proving to be a possible popular and just Boyar — something that perhaps Raganvad would be against.\n\n#bold As Godun, can you maintain your independence from Raganvad's overreach and maintain amicable relations with the east?#!"

 1084_kuloving_desc: "As one of the oldest Sturgian clans, the Kulovings have never really accepted the idea of a monarchy. Much like his late father, Olek "the Old", the younger Olek believes the boyars of the Principality be the lords of their own lands. While many understand the need for a Grand Prince, others believe it should not be a hereditary title.\n\nOriginally, the idea of the Grand Principality was supposed to be a confederation of Sturgian tribes for mutual aid and defense. Over time, it grew into a what it is today, a monarchy. With the slights from Raganvad building up, Olek is growing more and more impatient with the Grand Prince.\n\n#bold As Olek, will your patience with Raganvad boil over into all out war?#!"

Descended from local Sturgians and Imperial outcasts, they drove out the Alkit Khanate from Varnovapol and setup the city as a base for their raiding parties.\n\nYorig maintains this family tradition of raiding, and goes further than that. Raiding as far south as the Perassic, Yorig's coffers overflow with exotic wealth. He maintains a good standing with the Grand Prince by sharing the loot with Raganvad, who eagerly accepts it. However, Yorig yearns for true independence to raid whomever and keep that loot and prestige for himself.\n\n#bold As Yorig, can you negotiate your contract with Raganvad to benefit you?#!"

 1084_togaroving_desc: "Some feuds never die. For dozens of generations, the Sturgians of Revyl and Balgard have been in a perpetual state of rivalry since the times of legend. Although pacts and marriages have since cooled the simmering tensions, there's still just some fuel left for a spark to start again the fires of rivarly.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boyar of Revyl, Vyldur, is a kind and tempered lord who governs the people of the Kachyar Peninsula with fairness. To his north, the Nords make settlements along the spiny mountain ridges of the peninsula, and to his south lies the sea which allows his people direct access into foreign ports; either to trade with or to pillage.\n\n#bold As Vyldur, you're in a unique period of prosperity. However, the fabled whispers of the Norns describe a fate destined for Kachyar; one without you. Can you avert this destiny and keep a grasp on power?#!"

 1084_vezhoving_desc: "Residing along the coast of Mazopor Bay, the Boyar of Amezyh is a despicable man according to his peers. As the Boyar of Amezyh, he holds considerable influence over the straits leading into Lake Laconis, the other person being Boyar Tovir. Vashorki uses this fact in order to both empower himself with Nordic raiders, and to raid the shipping lanes of his enemies, who are normally his fellow Boyars. Raganvad tends to overlook these acts. For the Grand Prince, Vashorki's actions keep the Boyars infighting and weakened, allowing Raganvad to avoid any form of direct confrontation with his vassals.\n\n#bold Sturgians all around look down on you, Vashorki, but you care little for their opinions. Will you succeed in your ambitions, or will you fly too close to the sun?#!"

A relative minor family in Principality politics, Tovir prefers to keep out of the politics in general, opting instead to pick up the axe and shield for when his Grand Prince calls for war.\n\nOn an island just south of Dvorusta, the Lake Rats maintain a hideout with fiercesome independence. From this island, the Lake Rat marauders raid the coastline, including Tovir's holdings.\n\n#bold As Tovir, can you successfully keep yourself out of court politics or will you succumb to sea raiders?#!"

 # Kostoroving #
 1084_kostoroving: "Boyar Rolan"
 1084_kostoroving_desc: "Although Rolan is considered officially to be the clan head of the Kostoroving, everyone in the Grand Principality knows where the real power lies: his mother, Dakhila. Dominating her family's politics for the past fourty years, Dakhila has actually earned more respect among the Boyars than Rolan has himself. She utilizes that respect and the connections she has worked on over the decades to increase her family's station under the Grand Principality, allow Rolan the opportunity to gain lands.\n\nRaganvad is wary of the old crone. He believes her ultimate ambition is to have her family installed as the leaders of the Grand Principality, and so, he keeps a very close eye on the Kostarovings.\n\n#bold As Rolan, can you utilize your mother's connections to elevate your station, or will your family collapse into dust?#!"

 bm_1084_vlandia: "The Kingdom"
 bm_1084_vlandia_desc: "With its ruby banner emblazoned by a golden lion, the Kingdom of Vlandia is a land noted for its beleaguering baron lords and heavy cavalry. A land of deep tradition founded upon its Balionic roots, Vlandia has a long history on the continent of Calradia.\n\nNamed after the warlord, Wilund the Bold, Valandion in Calradic, they have also brought over their faith to the continent and syncretized it to the core beliefs of the Calradic Mandate system. Today, Vlandia exists as a multicultural land with differing faiths dispersed throughout it. In addition to that fact, cultural divides have been growing over the past few centuries.\n\nEver since the first landing by Wilund, those who followed after have been relegated to the lowest stratum of Vlandian society. A group of people can only take so much before the rift stays open for good, and the Vlandians must be mindful of their south — for the differences there are reaching a tipping point."

 1084_vlandia_derthert_desc: "In his youth, Derthert dey Meroc dreamt of the glorious conquest and chivalry that a kingdom under his rule would bring. However, once his father passed and the crown passed to Derthert, the reality struck harder and faster than he could realize. From that day onwards, the king has had to squash countless rebellions, pretenders, and keep the barons in line.\n\nYears of this have had a toll on Derthert who sees the futility in it all, but nevertheless tries to make the best out of the situation for as long as he can, whether that be elevating the commoners to offices of authority or through arbitration. Meanwhile, his son, Alary, is proving to be a possible popular king and the boy has a possible chance to unite the fracturious kingdom. However, there are murmors of unrest sturring in the southwest in the very heart of Meroc lands.\n\nAs Derthert, your kingdom is nearing the end of its era.

 1084_arromanc_desc: "The death of Catahild's brother, Endry, in the Battle of Pendraic, rocked the family to the core. Understanding that his life was not long for this world, Tredian, father of Catahild, insisted his remaining child be named heir to the House of Arromanc contrary to Vlandian custom. Although her ascension was marked by a significant breaking in Vlandian customs, it has not held her back in the slightest. She has consolidated her rule and rallied her family to her banner in the face of growing challenges.\n\nOne of these growing challenges is her cousin, Duke Ingalther of Cortain, who himself has a claim to Arromanc land through his mother, the late Lady Mitela. Although Derthert has refused to disinherit Catahild through his own reasons, the Cortains are still mustering the wealth and manpower to push this claim\n\n#bold As Catahild, can you overcome this mounting threat from your south, or will your land be robbed away?#!"
 # Dey Tihr #
 1084_tihr: "Duke Aldric"
 1084_tihr_desc: "When Osric "Iron Arm" conquered Vlandia in the late 10th century, he gave the land of Pravend to his second son, Jorian, as a way to stabilize the house and further exert Meroc control of the land. However, the children of Jorian took this as a slight to their pride, for why should they be used as pawns in the king's game? Jorian's first-born son and heir, Andraus, founded the "Tihr" cadet branch and so the House of Tihr came to be.\n\nToday, the differences between the Tihrs and Merocs are stark. While the Merocs rule in fairness and justice, even for the commonfolk, the Tihrs are considered by many, including their subjects, as greedy and depraved. It is said the daughter of Aldric, Liena, is the saving grace of the family.\n\n#bold As Duke Aldric, your son allows barbarians to raid your lands for his own ends.

Lord of the House of Cortain, Ingalther got his start by seizing the family estate from his much older illegitimate half-brother, Reichsin. Although ambition is a characteristic of most in Vlandian society, Ingalther's standards of the word are more than the extreme even by the same Vlandian standards\n\nAfter his brother and his family 'disappeared', Ingalther began to turn his eyes towards the next prize: Jaculan. There is a problem in the way though, and her name is Catahild, a cousin of Ingalther. Although her father lawfully passed off the House of Arromanc and his lands to her, Ingalther still believes it to be illegitimate and has began to muster forces through his own claim.\n\n#bold As Ingalther, will you successfully use your mother's claim to Jaculan to get what you rightfully deserve, or will it fall out of your grasp for good?#!"

Should someone earn the Duke's favor and maintain that favor, that person can be expected to be rewarded generously. However, if anyone crosses Duke Hecard dey Molarn, the ruthless and cruel nature of the family is a tempest to which there is little escape.\n\nThe same philosophy Hecard has with others, he extends to the people of Ostican. The people there are hard at work nearly all days of the week, but are rewarded handsomely for their work should quotas be met.\n\n#bold Hecard proves to be an effective taskmaster for his people, but with cultural differences brewing in his land, and Nord incursions rising, will you allow his domain to fall into ruin?#!"

 1084_gunric: "Duke Ospir"
 1084_gunric_desc: "Ospir is an example of a noble man, in other senses of the word, where work and valor pay very little in the lands of Vlandia. Fighting alongside King Derthert for years, Ospir has demonstrated to the rest of Vlandia that chivalry and honor is not dead. Again, however, that pays for very little in the end because instead of receiving rich lands in the south, the House of Gunric had been settled in the northern mountains.\n\nWith sea raider attacks every season and cultural differences causing issues, Ospir had to trade in his blade because no blade is worth governing with.\n\n#bold As Ospir, you live on the outer reaches of Vlandia, exposed to sea raiders and Nord invaders.

Ocs' descendants have occupied the heartland for centuries by this point. Today, the family maintains control from the mountains in the east to the Sea of Valandion to the west, ensuring that any caravans traveling north and south through Vlandia must pass through their lands. Although the Kings of Vlandia have chaffed at this, the Fortes have proven themselves powerful enough to either bribe or threaten the king.\n\nBelgir cares little for the throne, seeing as how its worn down Derthert into a husk of the man he once was.\n\n#bold As Belgir, will your caravan tolls provide to be a boon, or will your end finally come from above?#!"

 bm_1084_wimp_v_1_desc: "Should anyone require funds for their wars, the Varros family can provide. Although not much of a soldier himself, Apys still recognized the natural talent of Garios and elected to make an early alliance with him. Garios provided the fame, and Apys provided the money. Regardless of the populist decisions Garios may make, no doubt Apys will find some way to profit.\n\n#bold With ties to the Hidden Hand gang, Apys has an opportunity to use his influences to his own advantages. Will you, as Apys, bring in immense wealth for your family and perhaps even buy out the Emperorship, or will that castle of gold turn into dust?#!"

 bm_1084_wimp_e_1_desc: "A true democrat and person of the people, the Elaches family have a storied history of being the voice for the people. From the waning days of the Republic to today, they still maintain this tradition, giving them much more popular opinion amongst the common folk than their peers.\n\n#bold With the Empire in tatters and beating each other apart, the common folk are the ones who suffer the most. As Tynops, can you usurp the powers that be and bring about a democracy by and for the people, like the old Lotkian city states of old?#!"

Although a relatively new family to Calradian politics, the Comnos family are known for their fairness and justice among the common folk.\n\nWhen Emperor Arenicos died in March, the armies of Garios began their own march to avenge the dismantling of the legions and ensure no leader but their own can govern a reconstituted Empire.\n\n#bold As Garios, can you secure Heaven's Mandate and bring about a propserous rule under your legions?#!"

 1084_nimp_o_1_desc: "Renowned orator and petty oligarch, Lucon Osticos comes from a long line of senators stretching back to the founding of the Calradian Republic. Although his silver tongue dances to the tune of the sanctity of law and democracy, his true aims are the establishment of a Calradian Empire ran and governed by the Senate, not the soldiers or by blood.\n\n#bold As Lucon, will you succeed in this vision of a new Calradian Empire, or perhaps you may even restore the Republic of old?#!"

 bm_penton_neretzes: "Penton Neretzes"
 bm_penton_neretzes_desc: "Neretzes' Folly... the humiliation of that disasterous defeat will haunt Penton's family for ages. Penton's father, the late Emperor Drosios, led the Empire into a defeat along the parapets of a fortress outside Pendraic. The Battle of Pendraic, in the end, brought immense shame to the Neretzes family and the death of its patriarch.\n\nPenton, with ambition and vengeance in his heart, follows Lucon by tradition and by his own aims. Although Arenicos refused to eliminate Penton, the Emperor is dead and Penton could possibly use his claims to pursue his own Calradian Empire. However, his sister, Eodisia, could also rise up to that challenge.\n\n#bold As Penton, will you succeed in this endeavour or will your family's venerable history end in ash?#!"

 bm_1084_nimp_s_1_desc: "Porphalios' family once held land stretching from Epicrotea to Diathma. That all changed a hundred years ago when the Dryatic Palaic people rose up in rebellion. The Dryatics came down from their mountains to reclaim their ancestral lands. They were successful, if only for a short while. After two decades of rule, the Neretzes and Osticos families, with help from a dissident Dryatic, were able to overthrow the barbarian kingdom.\n\nUnfortanately, the land never went back to the Serapides. While that was a hundred years ago and much was forgiven, Porphalios yearns for those golden years yet again\n\n#bold As Porphalios, can you reclaim this lost heritage; stolen from your family by the Neretzes? The Dryatics still chafe at Imperial rule, so your decision may even influence their destiny.#!"

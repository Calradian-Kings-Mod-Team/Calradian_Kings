 # 1084 - Bannerlord
 ## Shadow of the Empire - 1084.5.1
 # Rhagaea
 challenge_character_rhagaea:0 "Empress Rhagaea"
 challenge_character_rhagaea_desc:0 "The wife of the late Emperor Arenicos, Rhagaea, withstood the onslaught of steppe raiders, and Aserai opportunists, to carve out her own empire in the ruins of the old.\n\n#bold Can you advert this fate and instead usher in a new golden age for Calradia under her heavenly-mandated leadership?#!"
 # Lucon
 challenge_character_lucon:0 "Emperor Lucon"
 challenge_character_lucon_desc:0 "Renowned orator and acclaimed general, Lucon's empire is defined by its traditional and republican values. Succumbing to nomad raiders and a Vaegir king, the empire crumbled with many of its notable traditions lost to time.\n\n#bold As Lucon, can you restore the power of the Senate and withstand the storm coming to your shores?#!"
 # Garios
 challenge_character_garios:0 "Emperor Garios"
 challenge_character_garios_desc:0 "The Western Empire withstood the foreign forces prodding at its underbelly for decades, but without its figurehead to rally around, the Calradian generals succumbed to infighting, allowing the new Sarranid Sultanate to take the southern coast.\n\n#bold Is the Western Empire doomed to infighting, or can you rally and strengthen the support of your generals for what is to come?#!"
 # Raganvad
 challenge_character_raganvad:0 "Grand Prince Raganvad"
 challenge_character_raganvad_desc:0 "Raganvad's ruthless leadership left much to be desired for the independence-minded Boyars. While many of them saw need for a Grand Prince, many more preferred it was not a hereditary position. Regardless, the western half of the Principality would splinter away under the leadership of a king who once served in the Vaegir Guard.\n\n#bold Raganvad's abrasive form of leadership is drawing the ire of his subjects. Can you wrangle in the unruly with cunning and dread?"
 # Caladog
 challenge_character_caladog:0 "High King Caladog"
 challenge_character_caladog_desc:0 "In a few centuries, the name Battania will bear little weight on the world. With Vlandians and Calradians to the south, as well as Sturgians and Nords to the north, the ancient High Kingdom would soon fade away into obscurity as its people resorted to banditry.\n\n#bold Caladog must ready the Battanians for their long journey ahead. The horizon is drawing closer, but can you expand that horizon and bring Battania out of this age of uncertainty?#!"
 # Derthert
 challenge_character_derthert:0 "King Derthert"
 challenge_character_derthert_desc:0 "Derthert was much unlike his great-grandfather, Osric. While Osric had the cunning and charisma to bring his vassals into line, Derthert had the impossible task of reining in his Vlandian vassals. The consequences of this resulted in the Rhodoks and a splintering of the kingdom into two.\n\n#bold A lot is at stake for the future of Vlandia. Can you maintain a steady grasp on power for when the inevitable Rhodok rebellion occurs, or will you fail?#!"
 # Monchug
 challenge_character_monchug:0 "Monchug Khan"
 challenge_character_monchug_desc:0 "The venerable clan of the Khuzuqs never stood a chance. [great_horde|E] came and swept away the accomplishments of the Urkhunaits, and in that moment of turmoil, the Khuzait clan would make the trek westwards, accomplishing the dream of Urkhun.\n\n#bold Will Monchug's greedy gaze westwards doom him to the threat that grows to his east, or will you take the Khuzaits and defend that which is yours?#!"
 # Unqid
 challenge_character_unqid:0 "Sultan Unqid"
 challenge_character_unqid_desc:0 "Unqid was beloved by all of his subjects, regardless of faith or culture. Nevertheless, a few did believe that they would be better suited to rule, and the result of those ambitions resulted in the Qild Uprising. The war left the Sultanate devastated enough for the Banu Sarran to form their own sultanate, the Sarranid Sultanate.\n\n#bold Such is the fate of all great realms if its subjects are left to their own ambitions. Can you slow and perhaps stop the machinations of your subjects, or will it all come crashing down?#!"
